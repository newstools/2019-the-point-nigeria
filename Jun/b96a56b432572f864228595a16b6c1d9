 By PRISCILLA DENNIS, Minna Senator Mohammed Sani Musa has commended the people of Niger East Senatorial District for standing behind him during his legal battle to reclaim his mandate from Senator David Umaru. He thanked the leadership of the All Progressives Congress for standing by him throughout the period while also extending his hands of fellowship to others who contested the election with him. Sani, in a press statement, said his presence at the senate would facilitate the development of Niger East senatorial district, and the state. The Supreme Court had on Friday, in its unanimous judgement, declared Sani Musa as the rightful candidate of the APC in the February National Assembly elections, having been validly nominated by the party in the primary election. It would be recalled that Musa took part in the election as the candidate of the APC and was returned elected as declared by INEC, but the Appeal court nullified his victory alleging that he was not the proper candidate of the APC. The court, in its ruling, had declared Umaru as the candidate of the party and awarded him the victory. However, not satisfied by the ruling Sani went to the Supreme Court to seek judicial redress and finally got his victory.
