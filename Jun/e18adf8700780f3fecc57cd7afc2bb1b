 Nigerian Tulip International College, Ogun Chapter, has offered full scholarship to its top four best graduating students to study at the Nile University of Nigeria in Abuja. Mr. Ercan Yilmaz, the College’s Principal, announced the scholarship offer at the Graduation and Valedictory of the College in Lagos. The outstanding students, who bagged the scholarship, include Kolapo Fuad, the best graduating Arts student, male category; and Abdullahi Shehu, best graduating Science student, male category. Others are Azizat Lawanson, the best graduating Arts student, female category; and Rekiya Tijani, the best graduating Science student, female category. In his address at the event, Mr Yilmaz said 66 students graduated in the set. He said that the four best students were offered scholarship to the college’s sister higher institution to celebrate and encourage hard work and excellence. Yilmaz said the graduands were more than adequate to face rigours of higher studies anywhere in the world. He said they had been equipped with good academic performance, good character and self discipline. “If they stay focused on their goal, meditate from time to time on various admonitions offered to them and do not stray from the path the school and home has set for them, in a couple of years they will become role models and celebrate success, God willing,” he said. The NTIC was formerly Nigerian Turkish International College, while the Nile University of Nigeria is its sister higher institution.
