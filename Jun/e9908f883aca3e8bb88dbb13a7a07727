 By Timothy Agbor, Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has called on members of the National Youth Service Corps to start thinking right from the camp of initiating meaningful community development service projects on their areas of primary places of assignments. Governor Oyetola gave this charge on Thursday while declaring the 2019 Batch ‘B’ orientation course open and swearing-in at the NYSC Osun State Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede, Osun state. Addressing the 2,600 corps members deployed to the Osun, Oyetola, represented by his deputy, Mr. Gboyega Alabi, said efforts to embark on projects at their various PPAs would keep the corps members from inappropriate behaviours while in camp and during service. He advised the corps members to channel their energy, vigour and drive towards the achievements of their CDS projects among other lofty ideals and aspirations. The governor advised the youths to abstain from vices such as drug abuse advance fee fraud, kidnapping, robbery, cultism, violence and crimes. These vices, according to Oyetola, undermine corps members and hinder them from being ray of hope for their generation and the nation. Governor Oyetola urged them to see themselves as leading light and see their service year as a means of completing the gestures of government and NYSC. Meanwhile, the Osun state coordinator of NYSC, Mr. Adegoke Adewale has urged Governor Oyetola to promptly pay the corps members their state allowances. The coordinator also called on the state government to build a befitting office complex for NYSC within Osogbo, the state capital. Adewale urged the corps members not to see their service year as sheer waste of time, but rather see it as a time to explore the richness in the culture and diversity of the people of Osun. He asked them to build quality friendship during their orientation and thereafter. Adewale urged the 1,430 male and 1170 female corps members to be job creators and not job seekers.
