By Abiola Adeleke The Ogiyan of Ejigbo in Osun State, Oba Omowonuola Oyeyode Oyesosin II (MFR), has reiterated the need for governments at all levels to beef up security around traditional rulers in the South West in particular and Nigeria in general in the light of the security threat posed by the rampaging killer herdsmen. Oba Omowonuola made the call in a statement made available to journalists by Mr Sesan Adeleke, Media Assistant to the Ogiyan of Ejigbo on Friday in response to the kidnap attempt on the monarch of Osi community in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Oba David Olajide, by Fulani herdsmen on Tuesday. The statement said the incessant herdsmen’s attacks on Yoruba monarchs were unbearable. It said the government must buckle up to secure the lives and properties of its citizens and the traditional rulers. It reads in parts, “It is risky to leave the traditional heads of the people unprotected. It makes them vulnerable to Fulani herdsmen that are ravaging the South West region of Nigeria now. “Recall that Oba Oyesosin had made a similar call in April when the Enogie of Ukhiri, Godwin Aigbein, was kidnapped at his palace in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. “Royal fathers, who are custodians of traditions of the people, are like commanders of the people. Politicians at the helm of affairs must strive to safeguard their own future by protecting the traditional rulers”. It said that things may soon get out hand if traditional rulers were left without adequate security.
