Mexican police have found cocaine worth thousands of dollars hidden inside more than a dozen bread rolls during an airport drugs raid. Sniffer dogs helped anti-narcotics officers to make the discovery at the international airport in Guadalajara, a major city in the west of the country. Each of the 15 rolls was filled with a bag containing 120g of cocaine. The market value of the illegal drug is around $150 (£116) per gram, meaning there would have been approximately $270,000 (£209,000) of it hiding in the rolls. Much of the cocaine sourced in Mexico is usually bound for the US, with officials having to deal with an increase in the number of small shipments at airports. It comes as the country continues to endure an unprecedented spate of murders linked to its war on drugs. Last year was the worst on record for murder, with more than 25,000 people killed, but 2018 is set to be even higher. The first six months saw almost 16,000 murders, with a report by the non-government organisation, Semaforo Delictivo, indicating that most were carried out by drug traffickers.
