 By Timothy Agbor, Osogbo Osun State Football Association on Monday elected a new chairman to pilot its affairs in the state for the next three years. Chief Mustapha, the chairman and sole financier of Ajiroba Football Club, succeeded late Chief Taiwo Ogunjobi. Mustapha polled 28 votes to defeat his co-contestant, Prince Ademola Bamidele, who had 8 votes. Bamidele had acted as the chairman after Ogunjobi’s demise. Meanwhile, Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, Osun state Chapter, has congratulated Chief Rasaq Mustapha over his victory at the chairmanship election of the Osun State Football Association. In a congratulatory message signed by the Chairman of Osun SWAN, Mr. Adeyemi Aboderin and the Secretary, Mr. Timothy Agbor and made available to journalists on Monday, the association charged Mustapha to ensure full implementation of his mission statements. The statement also commended Prince Ademola Bamidele for his desire to reposition the State’s Football Association. Sports writers in Osun, however, charged Mustapha to work with all stakeholders in the Football association in the state in order to bring about rapid developments and sense of belonging. Just like Mustapha and Bamidele promised to work together notwithstanding the outcome of the election during the debate organised by SWAN at the weekend, the statement urged the new chairman to extend hands of fellowship to Bamidele and other stakeholders in the state.
