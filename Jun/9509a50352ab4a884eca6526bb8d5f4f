 … Clerk insists on secret ballot  The Senate is currently in a state of confusion following a decision to adopt the secret ballot system for the election of presiding officers. The uproar started after the Clerk of the Senate, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, announced that the Senate will use the 2015 standing order. The 2015 order favours secret ballot. However, an Abuja High Court on Monday issued a judgement that the election should be by open ballot in tandem with provisions of the 2011 standing order. “No question shall be entertained and no motion shall emerge. But for the matter of respect, I think the question is whether I entertain any court order or not and the answer is no,” Mr Sani-Omolori said. Meanwhile, voting has commenced as each senator is given a ballot paper and proceed to the cubicle to cast his or her vote.
