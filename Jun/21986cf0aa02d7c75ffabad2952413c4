 By TIMOTHY AGBOR, Osogbo It was indeed a gory sight at the River side in Ilasa Ekiti, as a young herdsman, whose name has not been identified, chopped- off the head of his supposed wife with cutlass. The victim, who is also of the same tribe with the assailant, was attacked beside a stream where she had gone to fetch water with her younger sister. The assailant was said to have ambushed the lady and brought down her head while she bent to fetch some water from the stream. He was said to have taken to his heels after the incident but later arrested. Reports by some notable personalities in the community including the traditional ruler of the community, the Alasa of Ilasa Ekiti, Oba Ajayi Omolagba revealed that the young lady had been handed over to the assailant as his wife, while she was still a teenager in line with their custom. The Point gathered that trouble started last month, when the suspect requested the lady to spend the last Eld-el-Fitr with him. However, failure of the family of the deceased to meet up with the request was said to have angered the suspect before taking such dastardly act. Another report revealed that the lady after growing up, observed that the would-be husband was a drunkard and drug addict. In a chat with our correspondent, relatives of the deceased, who did not want their names mentioned, expressed sadness over the development. They affirmed that the suspected murderer made a request to spend the Eld-el-Fitr with his wife, adding that the lady was supposed to go to his house a day before he killed her. Speaking with newsmen, the Alasa of Ilasa Ekiti, Oba Ajayi Omolagba said the community was shocked by the ugly development. He said he had summoned the families of all parties involved and their landlords, while some resolutions were reached on how to forestall future occurrence. Oba Omolagba noted that the community would also do the needful to make necessary appease to god as such incident was strange and a taboo in the land.
