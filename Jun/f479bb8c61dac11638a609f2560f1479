 The Lagos State Government, as a follow up to the earlier notice, has advised motorists to plan their routes as Ashade, Akanni Doherty Street in Agege area would be shut to traffic tomorrow, Friday 28th night to Sunday morning, 30th June, 2019. This closure, according to the earlier release signed by the Permanent secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Taiwo Olufemi Salaam, is to allow the contractors of the project, CCECC and Devine Gate LTD, relocate and interconnect the 700mm diameter public water main in the said vicinity, in preparation for the on-going Nigerian Railway Modernization Project. The two-day closure will also be used for excavation across the said road, as well as laying of High Density Polyethylene pipes, backfilling and compaction. Motorists and the general public are urged to cooperate with the state government by using alternative routes around the area during the said period, to ensure a hitch free traffic flow.
