 The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has dismissed a viral claim that he plans to lead a street protest if the Presidential Election Tribunal ruled against him and his party. The debunked claim said that Atiku said his “server results are authentic” and he “will lead all Nigerians in a massive protest that mankind have never witness (sic) before” if “judges frustrate the justice..” However, in a statement made available to the media on Sunday, the PDP presidential candidate said the statement did not emanate from him or his aides. His words: “My attention has been drawn to a statement circulating in the media, to the effect that I plan to lead a street protest in the event that the election petition tribunal rules against my party and I on the issue of a server for the Independent National Electoral Commission.  “Such a statement did not emanate from me or my privies. It is the work of mischief makers who want to mar my spotless pro-democratic record and lay the ground work for their threatened actions against me on false charges of being a threat to national security. “For the avoidance of doubt, I believe in the Rule of Law and in the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In my almost four decades in politics, I have never taken action or spoken words against democracy and I will not start now.”  Atiku said he and his team have confidence in God over the tribunal’s proceedings. “My team and I have confidence in God and I call on those bent on mischief to have the fear of God and retrace their steps. Democracy has come to stay in Nigeria. The culture of fear being created now cannot rein in our democracy. Nigeria and Nigerians have a consistent history of outlasting tyranny and this we will continue to do so help us God,” he said.
