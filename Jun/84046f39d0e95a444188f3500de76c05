 President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday renamed the National Stadium Abuja to Moshood Abiola stadium as mark of honour to the late winner of the June 12 1993, Presidential Election. This was announced on Wednesday by the president while delivering his 2019 June 12 Democracy Day celebration at the Eagles Square Abuja. It would be recalled that Abiola had run for the presidency in 1993, but the election results were annulled by former military President, Ibrahim Babangida, popularly called IBB. But Buhari, on the 6th of June 2018 recognised the election and awarded Abiola posthumously with Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR) – award meant for Presidents. According to Buhari, the country only needs to get its acts together because it has all it takes to become a world power. Buhari was optimistic that Nigeria can do it, since nations like China, India and Indonesian achieved the feat, saying that Nigeria’s economy is expected to grow 2.7% this year. “Nigeria can do it,” he said. He noted that his administration has made remarkable progress in the fight against corruption, improving economy and securing the nation in the past four years. The president also assured that his administration in the next four years would consolidate on the achievements recorded in the past four years. He urged state governments and the private sector to play their own part, as the Federal Government cannot develop the nation alone. Buhari said that his administration will not tolerate any form of attack and violence against Nigerians in any part of the country, noting that the country’s unity is unshakable. “Join me in this journey of rebuilding our nation,” he added
