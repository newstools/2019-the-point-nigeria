The most prevalent offence recorded during the period was Seatbelt Use Violation with 1,492 offenders apprehended. More to this, Public enlightenment campaigns within the period increased by 5.7%” The recorded decrease in road traffic crashes during the 2019 celebration period came as a result of improved patrol operation, robust public enlightenment campaign, prompt rescue services, enhanced stakeholder collaboration, wider coverage of the national road network due to the establishment of more FRSC Commands, Outposts, road side clinics and Zebra points among others.

Kazeem finally stated that the positive changes in the reduction of offences and offenders, impoundments, and arraignments captured above is attributable to increase in Public Enlightenment, Enforcement, Traffic control, cooperation from Stakeholders, and the fully automated process of obtaining Drivers licence which ensures that Motorists must be trained in Driving Schools before they are qualified to apply for their Licence. To ensure further reduction in crashes on the road, the Corps Public Education Officer urged the motoring public to practice safe road use culture and give their maximum cooperation to FRSC personnel for the desired success. He also called on the general public to notify FRSC in the event of an emergency through its emergency line 0700-CALL-FRSC (0700-22553772) or toll free number 122 for prompt response as road safety is a shared responsibility.
