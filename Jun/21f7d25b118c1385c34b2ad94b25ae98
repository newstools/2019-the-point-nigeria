…as 183 members-elect endorse his aspiration Following his endorsement by 183 members-elect, the former majority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, has expressed confidence that he will emerge victorious in the race for the speakership of the 9th Assembly of the House of Representatives. The camp of Gbajabiamila, who is the anointed candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress for the position of the Speaker of House of Representatives, became upbeat and more confident with his endorsement by the 183 members-elect under the auspices of the Forum of  First Term Members of the House of Representatives, on Saturday, in Abuja. The Forum led by Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, the members drawn from across the six geo-political zones, took turns to announce and stamp their endorsement and support for Gbajabiamila and Ahmed Wase, the Deputy Speakership candidate. Gbajabiamila said in his speech on the occasion that having secured the endorsement of President Buhari, the ruling APC, all Nigerians, and legislators across party lines, he was now sure of victory. The Speakership candidate said it had become imperative for the legislature to have competent and highly experienced lawmaker to implement a developmental legislative agenda. He said he would ensure a synergy between the legislative and the executive arms of governments to foster democratic stability and good governance. According to Gbajabiamila, he has the requisite legislative experience to build on the gains of the 8th House to build growth and impact rapid development to his constituents and the country in general. On his part, the Director General of Gbajabiamila/Wase Campaign Organisation, Abdulmuminin Jibril said the endorsement was massive, adding that for the first termers to come together indicated that the candidature of Gbajabiamila would transform the legislative House. According to him, all antics deployed by opposition parliamentarians to discredit and denigrate the image of Gbajabiamila, and to frustrate his emergence as speaker, have failed woefully.
