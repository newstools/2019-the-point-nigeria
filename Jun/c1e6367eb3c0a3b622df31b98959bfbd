Prophet Jacob Ade Farinmade, the head of Celestial Church of Christ, Gospec Mission, Mosan, Ipaja, Lagos, has been arrested for secretly burying a female undergraduate he impregnated. The suspect allegedly secretly buried Bunmi after she died during childbirth and he didn’t inform her parents. The deceased was said to have been taken by her father to live with her mother, following her rustication in 200 level at Babcock University in 2014. Bunmi’s mother, Derayo Omisipi, thereafter took her to Farinmade for spiritual deliverance and protection. According to reports, the cleric, who already had more than 10 wives, took advantage of Bunmi’s stay in his church for the purported deliverance, to lure her to bed and impregnated her. It was learnt that the cleric did not allow the deceased to attend any antenatal clinic throughout the duration of her pregnancy. The cleric only broke the news of the girl’s death to her mother after he had buried her in a shallow grave near his church premises. The father of the deceased became curious after her mother could not offer satisfactory explanation about her whereabouts. He later reported the matter to the police and the cleric was arrested.
