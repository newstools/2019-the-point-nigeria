Speaking to BT Sport after the match, Klopp said: “I am so happy for the boys all these people, and my family. They suffer for me, they deserve it more than anybody.  “Did you ever see a team like, this, fighting with no fuel in the tank? And we have a keeper who makes difficult things look easy.  “It is the best night of our professional lives.  “It took a while, it is important for our development and improvement, This little mark helps a lot, now we can carry on. The owners never put pressure on us.  “Normally 20 minutes after the game I am half drunk, but now I have only had water!”
