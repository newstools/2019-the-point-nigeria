 Adeleke Adesanya The police in Nigeria are on the trail of an alleged homosexual Phillip Ayo Dike, who is suspected to have escaped from the county. Homosexualism is a criminal offence in Nigeria and the police in the country have in the last few years waged serious war against suspects, who indulge in any form of the act. The police had declared the alleged suspect wanted, after his partner, Dipede Johnson was arrested in April 2018 at a hotel in the Agege area of Lagos State. Ayo Dike was said to have escaped from the police after he was caught having sex with his partner at the hotel, while the partner was arrested. A police source, who pleaded anonymity, while speaking on the wanted suspects said ” he is suspected to have escaped from Nigeria because he knew that the long arm of the law would definitely track him in any part of the country” The police source narrated that ” he has been wanted since April 2018, when he was caught having sex with another man in the Agege area of Lagos State. “He and his partner had lodged in the hotel and were having sex when one of the hotel staff caught them and raised alarm “the police source stated. He also added that ” he was quick to have escaped before the hotel security could arrive at the scene, while his partner Dipede was arrested and prosecuted. ” Phillip Ayo Dike will be arrested, wherever he is to face the full wrath of the law in Nigeria to serve as a deterrent to other homosexuals in the country ” the police source insisted.
