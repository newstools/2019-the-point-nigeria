By BABALOLA HAKEEM A 72-year-old white garment church cleric, Rev. Jacob Adegboyega, has been arrested by the State Criminal Intelligence Investigation Department for allegedly killing one Ms. Bunmi, a 200 level student of the Babcock University, Illisan Remo, Ogun State. A police source at the SCIID, who pleaded anonymity, said the father of the murdered student had taken her to live with her mother after she was suspended from school. “The deceased was given a two-year suspension from school in 2014, after a fight that she was involved in. It was during the suspension that her father took her to her mother because they lived apart,” he said. But the deceased’s mother, identified as Adedayo Omisipi, later took her to the cleric, who already had 14 wives, for a spiritual deliverance. The police also disclosed that the cleric allegedly made a revelation to the late student’s mother, which he insisted she must
adhere to. The police source said, “After series of prayers, which Rev. Jacob claimed to have done, he told the lady’s mother that it was revealed to him that the student should not return to school but should marry him if she wanted for her to be cured of her spiritual problems or risk dying within a year. Her mother agreed and left her daughter with him to marry. “It was also revealed that the deceased got pregnant for the cleric, but he prevented her from going for antenatal care and decided to pray for her and was giving her concoctions at home. She, however, lost her life during child birth. The cleric only called her mother and gave her the bad news. “Before her mother got there the next day, the deceased had been buried and instead of her to report to the police, she even concealed her daughter’s death from the deceased’s father. She only told him that they had an argument and the deceased left home for an unknown destination. The matter was reported to the police and the cleric was arrested for further
interrogation.”
