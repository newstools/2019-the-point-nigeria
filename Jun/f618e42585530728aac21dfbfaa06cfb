 By TIMOTHY AGBOR, Osogbo The Hon member representing Ede North, Ede South, Egbedore and Ejigbo Federal constituency of Osun in the National Assembly, Hon Bamidele Salam, has offered automatic employment to four physically challenged persons to work as part of the staff in his constituency office. Salam made the announcement on Friday at a luncheon he hosted in honour of handicapped persons in his federal constituency. The federal lawmaker described persons living with disabilities as important segment of the society, who should be well-catered for by government and private citizens. He promised to initiate programmes to create job opportunities and encourage skills acquisition for less privileged members of Ede federal constituency. Salam said the offer of employment to four physically challenged persons as well as the luncheon in their honour, is a way of appreciating God for granting him the grace to serve the people as member of the House of Representatives. In his response, the Coordinator for the Association of persons with disability in Ede Zone, Mr Olanrewaju Oladosu commended Hon Bamidele Salam for hosting the party in honour of their members. While recalling that Hon Salam was the first Local Government Chairman to offer employment to people with disability in 2008, Mr Oladosu prayed that God will make the tenure of the Federal lawmaker a huge success. The programme, which was held as part of activities marking the inauguration of Hon Salam as a member of the House of Representatives, also featured presentation of gifts to physically challenged persons from the four local governments in the Federal constituency.
