 By TIMOTHY AGBOR, Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has met with Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai to seek speedy approval to allow soldiers to be part of the joint security team that would combat rising crimes in the state. The state government is set to set up a joint security patrol team of policemen, soldiers, and other agencies to patrol the highways and the dark spots where criminals launch attack on innocent citizens. According to a statement by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Adeniyi, Adesina, Oyetola told Buratai in his office in Abuja on Thursday that his visit was a follow-up to the letter of request the state sent to him to support the security in the state with soldiers’ participation in the joint security patrol plan. The governor said: “We believe security is paramount and it is the key to development. We need your full support for the joint patrol plan.” Oyetola also commended Buratai for the efforts of the military whose engineers are constructing a bridge across River Osun that connects Ede with Kuta and other communities. Governors of the SouthWest have also resolved to organise a security summit to prepare a joint plan to combat the rising crime in the geopolitical zone especially on the major highway from Ibadan to Akure, where bandits have scaled up their attacks on travellers. In his reaction, Buratai assured the governor that he would make all the efforts to support the security of Osun state so that the state could continue to keep its status as one of the most peaceful in the country. He reiterated that the army had always supported the police to keep internal security.
