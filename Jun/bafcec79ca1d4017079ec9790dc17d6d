As members of the Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria prepare for their 46th Annual General Meeting slated for July, in Asaba, Delta State, the association has unveiled a new identity in line with the repositioning drive of its current leadership. The theme for the AGM is ‘The War Within: Solutions for Survival.’ Speaking with journalists in Lagos recently, the president of the association, Ikechi Odigbo, who also announced that an advertising academy will take off this year, said the new logo unveiling was informed by the need to renew the value members of the association were known for. “Our new logo speaks about our DNA and repositions us as sectoral leader in the marketing communications industry. By DNA, I’m referring to our shared value in professionalism, creativity and excellence. We believe there is need to revive those values we stand for and re-jig the association for repositioning, hence the need for new identity. “Our blue colour stands for stability and reliability, while the orange speaks of vibrancy which touches on how we are winning Nigerians for our clients. With the new identity, we are telling stakeholders in the industry, including government and our clients that a new dawn is here,” On the theme of the year’s AGM, Odigbo said members thought of looking inwards and identified those challenges that were self-inflicted before looking at external factors that are threatening the growth of advertising business. He said speakers at the AGM would access the industry and point out how advertising practitioners can make their business to be more resilient.
