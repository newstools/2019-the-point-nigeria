  The President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmed Lawan, has reversed the appointment of Mr Festus Adedayo, as his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity. This is coming barely 48 hours after Mr. Adedayo’s appointment was announced. Mr. Mohammed Isa, Special Assistant to Ahmed Lawan on Media and Publicity made the announcement in a brief press statement Thursday afternoon in Abuja. “The office of the President of the Senate has reviewed the appointment of Mr. Festus Adedayo as Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the President of the Senate and decided to rescind its decision on the appointment, and wishes Mr. Adebayo the best in his future endeavours,” it said. An inside source told the News Agency of Nigeria that the decision to drop Adedayo was reached after a tête-à-tête by the Red Chamber’s top officers held at the residence of President of the Senate, Mr Ahmad Lawan, Wednesday night. Before his appointment, Adedayo, a PhD holder in Political Communication, was infamous as an ascerbic critic of the Buhari-led administration and ruling All Progressives Congress. His appointment Wednesday triggered political headwinds from party’s supporters who assert that the new President of the Senate appointed an outsider who does not believe in the philosophy of the party based on his known stance on anything APC. “You cannot drive an agenda with people who don’t believe in that agenda…how will you achieve your purpose If you bring in people who fought against your agenda,” a coalition of APC youths stated Thursday morning.
