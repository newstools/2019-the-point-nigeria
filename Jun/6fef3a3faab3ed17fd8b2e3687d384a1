 A final year student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Miss Chiwendu Ebenezer, is dead. Chiwendu, also known as Wendy by most of her friends, died on Monday evening in a ghastly motor accident at MayFair, Ile-Ife. She was a part 4 student of the Department of Accounting. According to Chiwendu’s departmental mate, who simply identified herself as Maria, Wendy was travelling to the campus before the crash occurred. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Federation of Catholic Students of OAU, a fellowship that the deceased belonged, has been thrown into mourning as the news of Wendy’s demise broke out. The fellowship has postponed the sports fiesta that was scheduled to begin tomorrow, in order to honour the late undergraduate. A statement issued by the Publicity Committee of the NFCS reads, “It’s with grief and a huge sense of loss that we announce the death of one of ours, Chiwendu Ebenezer, who most of us would have known as Wendy.” “Due to this, the sports fiesta preliminaries which was scheduled to begin tomorrow, has now been postponed indefinitely. “We urge us all to remember her in our prayers even as we continue to retrospect over our own lives. “May the soul of Wendy and those of other faithful departed Rest In Peace. Amen.”
