The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, on Monday, said he would not take a unilateral decision on the release of the Convener of RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, without recourse to the court. A statement by the minister’s Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Gwandu, indicated that Malami was reacting to a letter sent by a lawyer to the AGF requesting the release of Sowore. Sowore’s lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), had sent a letter to the AGF on Friday demanding his release from DSS custody. The AGF took over the case following the public outcry against the invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja by the operatives of the DSS to rearrest Sowore on December 6. AGF’s statement said, “When parties submit their issues for determination to a court of law, they lack exclusivity of decision over such issues without recourse to the court. “We remain guided by the established tradition and will not take unilateral decision without recourse to the rule of law.”
