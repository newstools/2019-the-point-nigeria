 A bitterly divided United States House of Representatives opened debate on Wednesday ahead of a vote on impeaching President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. AFP reports that Trumpâ€™s impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House, expected by the end of the day, would trigger a trial in the Senate. Republicans enjoy a majority in the Senate and are unlikely to vote to remove the 45th US president from office. Credit: AFP
