The Ondo State Government has deleted the names of 51 workers from its payroll, owing to the failure of the affected workers to present themselves for the recently conducted screening for civil servants. The screening exercise, according to the government, was conducted to enable it to ascertain the actual number of civil servants in the local government service. The Head of Service of the state, Mr. Dare Aragbaiye, confirmed this in Akure on Monday during the 2019 Public Service Week anniversary, with the theme: “ICT and innovative governance: Panacea for youth unemployment and migration.” He noted that the 51 workers failed to showed up for the screening exercise and had not returned to work since then. He stated, “Since they did not show up for the screening, that means they are ghost workers and for that reason, their salaries have been stopped and their names have been removed from the government’s payroll. “Even if they show up today, they have some questions to answer.”
