  The Department of State Services has rearrested the Presidential Candidate of the African Action Congress in the February 2019 election, Omoyele Sowore. This development is coming less than 24 hours after the news of his release on Thursday. According to Sahara Reporters, Sowore’s online newspaper, he has been taken to the DSS headquarters. He was rearrested after the judge was chased out of the court room with a gun, the paper alleged. Meanwhile, there had been chaos in the court room earlier on Friday.
Earlier at the proceedings, the judge and the defence counsel had commended the DSS for complying with the court’s order. In line with an agreement between the defence team, led by Mr. Femi Falana, and the Liman Hassan-led prosecution team, the matter was adjourned till February 11 for the commencement of trial. However, shortly after the court clerk called the next case and people started leaving the courtroom, about 15 DSS men started moving towards Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare. Reacting to the development, Sowore alleged that the DSS operatives were on the move to kill him.
