A new survey by the National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has put cash bribes to Nigerian public officials at about N675bn this year. The Corruption in Nigeria Survey Report, released on Friday, indicated that out of all Nigerians who had at least one contact with a public official in the 12 months prior to the survey, 30.2 per cent either paid a bribe to, or were asked to pay a bribe by a public official. Cash continues to be the dominant type of bribe, the survey says. The report said, “This means that, although still relatively high, the prevalence of bribery in Nigeria has undergone a moderate, yet statistically significant, decrease since 2016, when it stood at 32.3 per cent. “More than 93 per cent of all bribes paid in 2019 was paid in cash, a slightly larger share than in 2016. According to the 2019 survey, the average cash bribe paid is N5,754, a sum equivalent to roughly $52 in purchasing power parity. “Overall, it is estimated that a total of roughly N675bn was paid in cash bribes to public officials in Nigeria in 2019, corresponding to 0.52 per cent of the entire Gross Domestic Product of Nigeria.” The economic cost of bribery, according to the survey, becomes even more visible when considering that, on average, bribe-payers pay an amount equivalent to six per cent of the average annual income of Nigerians. “Around nine per cent of Nigerians considered corruption to be the most important problem facing their country, a significant
decrease from the 14 per cent recorded in the 2016 survey, ” it said. It added, “In 2019, Nigerian bribe-payers paid an average of six bribes in the 12 months prior to the survey, or one bribe every two months, which is virtually the same as the average of 5.8 bribes paid per bribe-payer in 2016. “As a result, it is estimated that some 117 million bribes are paid in Nigeria on a yearly basis, the equivalent of 1.1 bribes per adult.”
