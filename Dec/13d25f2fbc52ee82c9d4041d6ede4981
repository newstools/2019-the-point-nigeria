A former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke (SAN), has been arrested in Abuja. Adoke’s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) confirmed his arrest on Thursday to our correspondent, disclosing that he was arrested shortly after he arrived the Abuja airport from Dubai, the United Arab Emirate. He was said to have been picked up at the foot of the aircraft by Interpol, who allegedly prevented him from having access to anyone. Ozekhome, in a short text message to our correspondent, however, said, “He returned voluntarily to Nigeria… Yes, he was arrested by Interpol and handed over to EFCC (the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission).” He had, through his lawyer, said earlier that he would voluntarily turn himself in to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on his arrival in Nigeria. Adoke was said to have boarded a flight to Nigeria from Dubai after he was released from Interpol custody. Warrants of arrest had been issued in April 2019 for two former ministers, including Adoke, and an Eni manager over the sale of offshore oil field OPL 245 by Malabu Oil and Gas in 2011. The $1.3bn deal has triggered legal cases across several countries Adoke, who had been on self-exile since the end of his tenure in 2015, was arrested in November by Interpol in Dubai over some pending charges in connection with the Malabu Oil deal in Nigeria.
