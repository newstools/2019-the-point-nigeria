 . It was a selection, not an election – APC The Peoples Democratic Party has swept 20 out of 21 chairmanship seats in the local government elections in Adamawa State, unofficial results have indicated. The Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress has, however, rejected the outcome of the council elections conducted in the state, even as results for one council were still being awaited. The Legal Adviser of the party in the state, Shagnah Pwamadi, said the election was “a selection backed by law enforcement agents,” adding that the APC had no choice but to reject the result of the polls. He stated, “The APC is rejecting the outcomes of the election because it was not conducted in compliance with the provision of the Adamawa State electoral law. “Therefore, it is undemocratic and a clear display of an act of selection backed by law enforcement agencies. The APC also alleged that the elections fell below standards because 95 per cent of ad hoc electoral officials recruited by ADSIEC for the exercise were PDP card-carrying members.
