The Federal Government has ordered the release of former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki and convener of RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore. This was disclosed in a statement, on Tuesday, by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. The decision to release them, according to Malami, is in compliance with the bail granted earlier by the court. He said, “The two defendants are enjoined to observe the terms of their bail and refrain from engaging in any act that is inimical to public peace and national security as well as their ongoing trial which will run its course in accordance with the laws of the land.” The Point had exclusively reported that, owing to what analysts linked to a perceived disrespect for the rule of law by the Federal Govenment, and the resultant loss of investor confidence, the Nigerian stock market had lost N229bn in Market Capitalisation from the day Sowore was rearrested to Friday.
