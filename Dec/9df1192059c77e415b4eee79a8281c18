Finally, after consistent public outcry against his continued detention, the Department of State Services has released the Publisher of Sahara Reporters and Convener of the RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore. Sahara Reporters disclosed this through its verified Twitter handle @SaharaReporters, shortly after the Federal Government ordered the release of both Sowore and former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. “He was released on Tuesday evening following an order to the Department of State Services by Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), for his freedom,” the online media outfit tweeted.
