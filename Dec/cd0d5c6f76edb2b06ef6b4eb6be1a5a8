… Club free to sign players Jan Chelsea is free to sign new players in the January transfer window after a FIFA-imposed ban was reduced on appeal by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday. The ban was imposed following violations in the recruitment of minors. It was reduced from two transfer windows to one, which Chelsea already served in the summer. A CAS statement said that Chelsea were guilty of violating rules related to the international transfer and registration of minors, “but for a significantly smaller number of players.” They were only guilty of one-third of the violations found by FIFA, it said. A fine was reduced from 600,000 Swiss francs ($607,000; £462,000) to half that amount by the Lausanne-based court.
