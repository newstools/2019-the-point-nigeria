The Court of Appeal, in Lagos, has dismissed an appeal by a former Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Dr. Joseph Nwobike, challenging his conviction by the Lagos High Court. The former SAN was convicted in April, last year, following allegations that he attempted to pervert the course of justice by inducing court registrars to ensure his cases were assigned to preferred judges in order to get favourable judgments. He was convicted of 12 counts and sentenced to one month imprisonment by Justice Raliat Adebiyi. Following his conviction for corruption, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee stripped the senior legal practitioner of his SAN rank, after which he approached the Appeal Court. The Court of Appeal, in its judgment, on Thursday, however, threw away the ex SANâ€™s appeal, saying it lacked merit.
