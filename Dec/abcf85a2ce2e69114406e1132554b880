There was palpable tension on Monday in Ajowa, Akoko Northwest Local Government Area when irate youths in the community resisted a truck loaded with herdsmen, who allegedly wanted to settle in the town without giving notice. According to the Chairman, Ajowa- in-Council, the Oloso of Oso-Oba, Clement Jimoh, the arrival in the community of over 200 herdsmen is an embarrassment to the peaceful community. He said the monarchs, elders and security agents prevailed on the youths not to take laws in their hands. Another monarch, the Oluro of Uro Ajowa, Oba Tlmothy Ipinmoroti, disclosed that Ajowa-Akoko remained one of the most hospitable communities in Yorubaland, but the way the herdsmen was suspicion and called for caution. Chairman of Ajowa Akoko community, Bakare Ajayi, said Ajowa as a gateway town, needed a lot of consciousnesses. Besides, he said they were battling with herdsmen in their farms who usually use their cows to vandalise crops coupled with the security challenges of kidnapping in the axis. According to him, they need to be security-conscious alleging they found in the herdsmenâ€™s luggages dangerous weapons like axes, sharp cutlasses and swords. One of the herdsmen, simply identified as Issa Ahmed, said some indigenes took money from them before they decided to come for settlement. The Ikare Area Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Razak Rauf confirmed the incident, saying investigation was on. Recall that about two years ago a similar thing happened at Akunu and Auga in Akoko Northeast Local Government Area of Ondo State, resulting in an emergency meeting of Akoko monarchs at Isua presided over by Olukare of Ikare,Oba Akadiri Momoh, the immediate past chairman of Ondo State Council of Obas.
