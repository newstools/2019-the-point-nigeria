 The Independent National Electoral Commission on Friday said it would study the Supreme Court judgement in Zamfara State and come out with the commission’s decision on Monday, May 27, 2019. INEC’s National Commissioner, and Chairman, Information, and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye made this disclosure in a press statement released by the commission on Friday, shortly after the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. The Apex Court, in an unanimous decision said the All Progressives Congress did not conduct primary elections and therefore, did not participate in the 2019 general election. It therefore nullified the votes cast for APC candidates across board in the election. By the unanimous judgement, all candidates of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, Nigeria’s main opposition party are to benefit as winners of the governorship, National Assembly, and State House of Assembly, being the first runners up in the elections. Okoye, in the press statement, said that the commission immediately after the judgement held an emergency meeting which will continue tomorrow, Saturday May 25. “The final decision on the matter will be communicated to the public on Monday May 27, 2019,” he said.
