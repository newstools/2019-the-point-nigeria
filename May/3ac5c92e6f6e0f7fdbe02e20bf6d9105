 The National Examination Council has commissioned a total of 20 single Cabin Hilx Vans and 8000 units of Biometric Capture Devices to the tune of N827.8 million. The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Arch. Sonny T. Echono, made the disclosure during the commissioning of the items in Minna, Niger state, at the councils’ headquarters. The permanent secretary, who was represented by Abdulrahaman Koko, Director Human Resources said the vans will help to ensure hitch free conduct of exams, while the biometric machines will reduce the increasing incidence of examination impersonation by candidates. “Due to lack of enough vehicles during the last exams, we have to go to INEC and beg them to release 32 of their cars for us. And a lot of candidates sit for exams for others and this is becoming a major problem in exams in Nigeria. Now, with biometric capture devices, anyone caught impersonating in the exams will be sent out of the hall.” Earlier, the Acting Registrar/ Chief Executive of NECO, Abubakar Mohammed Gana explained that the 20 Vans cost N327.8m, while the 8000 Biometric machines which cost N500m, will enhance the operation of the organization in the area of logistics and overall security of its exams. Gana added that lack of vehicles have hampered the smooth conduct of examination, as the last time the council bought vehicles was in 2013.
