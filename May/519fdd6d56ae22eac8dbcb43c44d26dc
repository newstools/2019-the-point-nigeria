  President Muhammadu Buhari last Wednesday ordered all ministers to hand over to the Permanent Secretaries in their respective ministries next Tuesday, however, there are indications at the weekend that the new cabinet may not be constituted as soon as expected. Investigations by The Point showed that the president is still keeping the list of the new cabinet to his chest. A top source from one of the anti-graft agencies, said the President is yet to submit the names of any nominee for screening, saying that is an indication that the list is not ready. “We are yet to receive any list for screening from the presidency and you know that is the beginning of the process. Screening of nominees by security and anti-graft agencies takes time. So, if the list is not yet released to us, then you know the cabinet will not be constituted so soon”, the source who doesn’t want his name in print, told The Point. The Point also gathered from a source close to the presidency that the president is taking his time in gathering those who will work with him in his second term, as he believes the times we are in, requires the best for the country. When asked about different names being touted around, he said “it is a normal thing around this time.” “There will be a lot of speculations, but the president is the one that will announce his cabinet”, the source said. It would be recalled that it took President Muhammadu Buhari almost a year in office, before he announced his cabinet in the outgoing first term.
