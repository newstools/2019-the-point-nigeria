A 16-year-old student of Adeoye Lambo Grammar School, Muyibat Akanbi, has  reportedly drowned in Owiwi dam, Obada-Oko in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of Ogun State. Muyibat, with four other senior secondary school 1 (SS1) students of the school, was said to have gone to the dam at 12 noon penultimate Monday to swim shortly after they were through with their second term examination. An eyewitness said that the two female students among the five, Muyibat and Anita Godwin, had initially refused to swim because of the warning sign erected near the dam indicating that swimmers are not allowed. However, the male students defied the warning and persuaded the girls to swim. Speaking under the condition of anonymity, the eyewitness said the boys suddenly discovered that the two girls had disappeared. They called for help when it dawned on them that the girls had drowned in the dam. It was gathered that Muyibat, one of the two girls, was brought out dead from the dam. Anita, who survived, was said to have been taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. In her reaction, the principal of the school, Mrs Dunsi, expressed surprise that the students disregarded  warnings by the school authority. The Point learnt that the remains of Muyibat had been released to Akanni Kolawole, the deceased’s uncle for burial.
