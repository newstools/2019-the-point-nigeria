 The Peoples Democratic Party, Osun State chapter, has lauded the judgement of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, that declared that Senator Ademola Adeleke was eligible to contest the 2018 governorship election in Osun state. The party said the Appeal Court’s decision to come out clean on the eligibility case that was filed against the party’s candidate, Senator Adeleke by some members of the All Progressives Congress in the state, has rekindled the hope of the common man in the nation’s judiciary. The PDP state Chairman, Hon Olasoji Adagunodo, in a release made available to our correspondent said “it was a moment of joy and delight to all Nigerians, not only for Osun State people, but for all who witnessed how the Osun State governorship election was manipulated by the powers that be on September, 22nd, 2018. According to Adagunodo, “there is still hope for the ordinary man through our judiciary.” He said that the PDP and Adeleke have been vindicated by the   judgment of Thursday, May 30, 2019, adding that the judiciary needed to purge itself of a few ones who are hell bent on tarnishing the image of the noble men of the Bar and Bench. Adagunodo also expressed delight that Justice Agim saw what ordinary citizens, who are not lawyers, saw and with his scolding the Bwari High Court judgment, as uncalled for. Adagunodo prayed for success for his party and its candidate at the Supreme Court. He said the PDP had done all that was necessary from the polling units on September 22nd 2018, up to the last day at the election petition tribunal to deserve unhindered victory up to the Supreme Court by the special grace of God. He implored all supporters of Adeleke and PDP not to relent in their prayers for  victory at the Supreme Court for their candidate and the party especially during this Ramadan season.
