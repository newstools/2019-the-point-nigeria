 Yoruba Youth Forum has berated the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for what it called the governor’s “regular disrespect to the Yorubaland.” The YYF, speaking through its President, Hon Adebayo Fabiyi, took exception to Wike’s beration of Yoruba leadership on public television, claiming that Yoruba leaders worked against his election. Fabiyi said,” This clam is crude, false and malicious. This is quite sad, unacceptable, benighted, illogic, suffused in inherent hate and animadversion.” The YYF said that Wike and ilk should take note that it would henceforth not tolerate any attempt by anyone to denigrate our leaders. “Our leaders are sacred and sacrosanct builders and enlightened shepherds of our community. We will never insult leaders of other region. “This much, we expect from the constituents of other regions. “But for whatever reason best known to him, Wike has now made it habitual to be throwing stones at Yorubaland.” While appealing to Wike for the last time that the Yorubaland will never accept any intrusive intervention in her affairs, the YYF added, “Let him confine himself to his own region and basically mind his own business. “Should he undertake any reckless diatribe against our leaders again, we will respond with equal venom and necessary truculence. “Enough is enough,” he warned.
