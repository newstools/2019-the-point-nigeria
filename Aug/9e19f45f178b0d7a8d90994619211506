 Celebrity photographer, Busola Dakolo, wife of Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, says she was forced by police at gunpoint to sign a document countering her rape allegations against Biodun Fatoyinbo, the founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly. Recall that Mrs. Dakolo had alleged that the pastor had sexual relations with her when she was 16 going to 17 in Ilorin, Kwara state. However, in an interview with UK Guardian, Busola narrated how she was forced into a van by some armed men, who mandated her to speak with their superior officer in Pidgin language. The celebrity photographer recounted how she was handed a document containing allegations of “criminal conspiracy, falsehood, mischief and threat to life” to sign. Busola said the contents of the letter were not leveled against Biodun Fatoyinbo, but against she and her husband. “One was holding a gun and the second, a letter. They told me they were from IG’s (Inspector General of Police) office in Abuja and that I needed to sign this letter and acknowledge it,” Busola said. According to her, this occurred after a tinted minibus followed her while she was driving into her home in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial city. Busola and her husband were on July 23, invited by the special tactical squad of the IGP for questioning over allegations of “falsehood and criminal conspiracy,” albeit, without extending the gesture to Fatoyinbo. “Our culture doesn’t allow speaking of these sorts of things against anointed men of God. They’d rather hide it, and the party that is being victimized tends to live with that self-blame,” she said. “The damage on the survivor is extremely terrible but the society, the church, keeps sweeping things under the carpet.”
