 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has denied raiding the home of immediate past governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode in the early hours of Tuesday. The commission, in a statement signed by Tony Orilade, Ag. Head Media & Publicity, said cntrary to the news going around especially on social media, the former governor’s administration is only being investigated just like other governors, since they no longer enjoy immunity. The statement reads in part; “We need to state for the records that the EFCC did not raid Ambode’s house. It is instructive that his administration, like other former governors is under investigation, since they no longer constitutionally enjoy immunity against prosecution. “The Commission hereby states with high sense of responsibility that the operatives did not raid Ambode’s residence. “Whatever the Commission is presently doing with regards to the investigation is in line with its mandate and the rule of law. “We wish to inform the social media to be circumspect in the reportage of any news with regards to investigation activities of the Commission. “As a tradition, the Commission does not carry out investigation on the pages of the newspapers or through the media. Our operations are always covert until at a time when we file charges in court. “Therefore, the attempt to cast the Commission in a bad light is unacceptable as the EFCC will never engage in illegal act. We remain committed to the war against corruption.”
