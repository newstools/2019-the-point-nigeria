 Kano State Governor, Alhaji Abdullahi Ganduje, on Sunday directed district heads in the state to only attend the Eid Durbars organised in their respective domains and supervised by their respective first class Emirs. Governor Ganduje’s Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, gave this order in a statement in Kano. According to the statement, the order became necessary to counter social media news directing the district heads to attend Eid Durbar at the palace of the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. The governor’s order, however, ran contrary to the age-long tradition, where all district heads naturally attended the Durbar hosted by the Kano Emir. The statement reads, “Against some calls circulating in the social media that all district heads were directed to attend Hawan Daushe at Kano Emir’s palace, the Kano State Government has directed all Hakimai to attend Hawan Daushe at their respective emirates,” the statement read. “It is therefore directed that district heads from Bichi Emirate should attend their Hawan Daushe with the first-class Emir of Bichi, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero; District Heads from Rano Emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir, Alhaji Dr Tafida Abubakar (Autan Bawo). “All district heads from Karaye Emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir, Alhaji Dr Ibrahim Abubakar II; all district heads from Gaya Emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdulkadir; and those district heads from Kano Emirate are also directed to attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir, Muhammadu Sanusi II.” Governor Ganduje and Emir Sanusi had earlier participated in the Eid-el-Kabir prayers at the Kofar Mata Central Eid ground in Kano township. The prayers were led by the Emir.
