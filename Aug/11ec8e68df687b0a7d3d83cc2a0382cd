 By Osemwengie Ben Ogbemudia, Benin An APC chieftain and former Chief Press Secretary to the Edo State Governor, Prince John Mayaki has filed a petition against the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu and the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie at the Code of Conduct Tribunal over abuse of office and breach of the constitution. Mayaki was a former CPS to Governor Obaseki. The seasoned-journalist, who has been at the heart of a campaign demanding accountability and adherence to the rule of law from the Edo state government, submitted the petition on Friday, August 9th, at the Federal Secretariat in Abuja. The petition is centered on the partial inauguration of the 7th Edo Assembly orchestrated by Obaseki in an alleged connivance with the other parties named and the refusal of the governor to follow the resolution of both arms of the National Assembly declaring the inauguration exercise an act of illegality and the call for a fresh, proper proclamation for an all-inclusive inauguration of the House. Mayaki, in the petition, stated; “That the Executive Governor of Edo State and the other parties mentioned above have jointly and severally abused their office by engaging in an arbitrary act of unlawful excluding 14 elected members of EDHA from participating in the first session of the House of Assembly of the State held on 17th June 2019 by the Governor’s act of clandestinely issuing a proclamation without notice to 14 elected members of the EDHA and the general public in Edo State, an act which is prejudicial to the rights of any other person knowing that such act is unlawful Act and contrary to Government Policy. “That the Executive Governor of Edo State and the other parties mentioned above have jointly and severally abused their office by engaging in an arbitrary act of unlawfully refusing to comply with the resolutions of the National Assembly directing the Executive Governor of Edo State to issue valid proclamation for the first session of the EDHA in accordance with the provisions of section 105(3) of the 1999 Constitution, an act which is prejudicial to the rights of any of the 14 elected members of the EDHA and the general public knowing that such failure to comply with both resolutions of the National Assembly amounts to an unlawful act and contrary to Government Policy.” Mayaki, through the petition, is calling for the application of laws that stipulate punishment for public officers guilty of abuse of office and breach of the constitution. If successful, this could see the governor and the other listed officers, removed from office and barred from holding any other public office for a period of ten years.
