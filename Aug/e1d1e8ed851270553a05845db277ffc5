 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Senator representing Osun East Senatorial District, Senator Francis Fadahunsi, has called on Muslims in the country to use the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir to emulate the essence of the Islamic festival, which is obedience to God through sacrifice. According to him, sacrificial obedience is the hallmark of a true religious person. The Osun Senator made the call in a sallah message signed by his Special Adviser on media, Sam Segun-Progress, adding that the festival should be a reminder of the sacrificial life expected of us as responsible citizens and in submission to God’s will. Calling on Muslim faithful not to be tempted in replacing the significance of the season with feasting, Senator Fadahunsi said that the exemplary obedience of the patriarch of faith, Prophet Ibrahim, should be the motivation that should make Nigerians better people living in love and harmony. “As we celebrate this great occasion, let us renew our love one for another, let us learn to make sacrifices that can impact on the people and make our state and nation a better place” The Senate Deputy Chairman on Customs and Excise also called on the people of Osun East Senatorial District to celebrate with moderation, adding that “the celebration is a religious ritual that should not lose its purpose”. While wishing all the Indigenes and residents of the constituency, especially adherents of the Islamic faith a happy Eid-el-Kabir, the Senator encouraged them to continue to pray for the nation and those in charge of its affairs “so that together we can have a better nation”.
