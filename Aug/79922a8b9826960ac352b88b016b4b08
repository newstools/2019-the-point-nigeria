 Men of Ogun State Police Command have arrested the duo of Lekan Odusote, 27 years old of Sanga area Ijebu-Ode and Monday John, 22 years old of Molipa Estate Ijebu-Ode, over the killing of yet to be identified okada rider. The two suspects allegedly lured the bike man to Ikangba area Obalende in Ijebu-Ode where they killed him and took his corpse to an uncompleted building, dug a shallow grave and buried him there. Having done with the Okada man, they took his motorcycle to Ijebu-Igbo where they sold it at the rate of N120,000. Luck however ran against them when they were about to share the money. The inability to agree on a particular sharing formula had led to a serious altercation between the two of them as some of their statements aroused the suspicion of people around who immediately informed the police. When the police received the information, the DPO Obalende division, CSP Sunday Omonijo was said to have swiftly dispatched his detectives to effect the arrest of the two suspects. On interrogation, they confessed luring the Okada man to an isolated area, where they killed him and took possession of the motorcycle which they sold, and the sharing formula caused disagreement between them. The suspects later took some policemen to the uncompleted building where the victim was buried. The police recovered corpse and took it to mortuary for post mortem examination. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Bashir Makama has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
