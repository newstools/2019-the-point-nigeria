 The Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has said that his refusal to attend an Igbo event in Spain was not to avoid assault from members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, who may be residing in the country. Kalu, a two-term governor of Abia State, gave the explanation in a statement issued on Monday by his media office. He described reports in some social media platforms that he suspended a medical trip to Germany following attacks on Senator Ike Ekweremadu, as totally untrue. He said the report was untrue. Ekweremadu was physically assaulted in Germany, on Saturday, by members of the IPOB. The former Deputy Senate President was invited as a guest speaker at the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival in Nuremberg, Germany, when the assault took place. Kalu explained that he has been in his country home, Igbere, interacting with members of his constituency since the National Assembly went on recess. The Senator said he had held several meetings with the people of Abia North at his Camp Neya residence in Igbere. The statement read in part, “I have been in my country home interacting with people from my constituency and settling disputes. “The news that I suspended by planned medical check-up in Germany was not true. “I was invited by an Igbo group in Spain to attend their function, I could not go because of the interaction with my constituents.” He described the action of the IPOB members against Ekweremadu as uncivilised, unacceptable and barbaric. He said the assault on the Senator was a slap on Igbo leaders regardless of party affiliation, describing Ekweremadu as a prominent Nigerian who deserves to be respected. Kalu, therefore, urged the Igbo to respect their leaders at all levels and embrace peace, saying only then will the South-East region be prosperous and peaceful.
