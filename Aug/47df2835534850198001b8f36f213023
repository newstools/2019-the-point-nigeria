 By TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The police have arraigned five persons for allegedly participating in the recently held RevolutionNow protest in Osogbo, capital of Osun state. Those who were dragged before Magistrate A. Ajanaku of an Osogbo Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday are Owolabi Olawale, aged 32, Fagunwa Temitope (29), Oluwafemi Johnson (28), Owoeye Olaoluwa (22) and Omoleye Stephen (21). The five accused persons were arraigned on three-count charge of unlawful assembly as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear and disturb the peace of the community and gathering of each other in a manner likely to cause breach of peace. The police prosecutor, Mr Felix Okafor, told the court that the five accused persons and other that escaped the scene of the alleged protest committed the offences on the 5th of August, 2019 at Olaiya Area, Osogbo. Okafor argued that the offence contravened the provision of sections 517,69 and 249 (d) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol II, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002. However, the five accused persons pleaded not guilty to the offences slammed against them by the police. Counsel to the defendants, Adegoke pleaded with the court to grant his clients bail in the most liberal term. Adegoke explained to the Court that some of the accused persons are students and that they were coming form a press conference at Osun NUJ correspondents’ chapel at Olaiya before they were arrested by the Police. Magistrate Ajanaku however granted the five accused persons bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety each. The case was adjourned till 16th of August 2019 for mention.
