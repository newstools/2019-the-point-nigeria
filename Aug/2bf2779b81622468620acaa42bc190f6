By SEGUN AYINDE, ABEOKUTA Ogun State government has announced that about 25,000 unemployed persons have registered with its job portal, which was launched last Thursday. The government said that it had already started analysing the profiles and in a couple of weeks it would commence the matching of those on the database and linking them with prospective employers. The Special Adviser to the governor on Job Creation and Youth Empowerment, Mr. Dele Olude disclosed this on Monday. Olude said that whopping sum of 24,815 had registered as the time of filling this report as more were still registering. Olude said that the state Governor Dapo Abiodun had ordered that all glitches causing the malfunctioning of the Jobs Portal be cleared following calls from some sections that it was difficult to access. He described the state governor as a man of vision who would not settle for anything less than quality, noting that he officially launched the portal alongside the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo because of the premium placed on youth employment and human capital development. Olude however urged those who had issues during their registration to go back online and complete their applications, as he charged them to follow the same process which the over 25,000 applicants used in registering, hinting that the government had placed the management of the portal in the hands of very competent professionals. He said, “The diversity of applications received is also overwhelming. They cut across careers, ages and ethnic backgrounds. People have applied from all over the country and beyond.” “Artisans and craftsmen and women should also know that we expect them to also register as we are planning tons of programmes for their empowerment,” he added.
