 AYO ESAN, ABUJA A political activist and former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Timi Frank, has described the tribunal judgement sacking Dino Melaye as senator representing Kogi West as a distraction from his governorship ambition. Frank expressed optimism that the Appeal Court will do justice to the case. Reacting in a statement on Friday to the tribunal judgement sacking and ordering fresh election in Kogi West Senatorial District, Frank urged Melaye’s constituents to be resolute and be rest assured that the outspoken Senator truly won his election. Frank, while commending the chairman of the panel “for standing by the truth,” added that “all efforts by the desperate APC to remove the best performing senator from the red chamber will fail woefully at the Appeal Court. “Lies may succeed for a while, but the truth will surely prevail. I urge the vibrant Senator Melaye not to lose focus, believe in God of justice and surely bear in mind that all his enemies will be put to shame.” Frank, who also called on Melaye’s constituents to stand by him and not allow “evil to prevail on their worthy representative,” said the Senator’s governorship ambition should not be threatened by the tribunal judgment, which he described as ‘distraction.’ The political activist revealed that the ruling APC elements were behind the ‘miscarriage of justice’ at the tribunal on Friday, “because they are afraid that if Senator Dino Melaye finally secure the governorship ticket of the PDP, he will certainly win the election and uproot APC in Kogi state.”
