 Chairman of Lucinda Media Limited (owners of Sweet 107.1FM), Senator Olugbenga Obadara has charged Nigerians to be a lot more hopeful going forward. The former Legislator said this in a signed statement on Sunday in which he also felicitated with Muslim Faithful on Sallah. “Sallah constantly reminds us that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We should be a lot more hopeful going forward.” He further stressed: “While i take this occasion to felicitate with Nigerian Muslim Faithful across the world, i wish to encourage us all to renew our zeal and be resilent at working to ensure better days are ahead.” The Media Chief Executive also used the medium to encourage Muslims to show by their words and conduct that Islam is a religion of peace. He said: “It is true that some mischief makers have made several attempts at dividing us across religious line; constantly causing trouble and unrest in different parts of the Country.” “True Muslims are peaceful people and I hereby urge true muslims to exemplify peace and good character by words and deeds so mischief makers can be clearly separated from Islamic Faithful”, Obadara added. He concluded that just as God had plans for Ismail and provided succour back then, he is certain that God has great plans for us as individuals and Nigeria as a Soverign Nation. “Back in the holy books, we read of God’s plans for Ismail and how he used a ram to provide him with succour.” “I am also optimistic that God will provide Nigeria and Nigerians with succour. He has plans for us. We just have to be more obedient to God’s laws as well as uphold the Nigerian Constitution”, he said.
