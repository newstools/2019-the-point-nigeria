 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Catholic Bishop of Oyo Diocese, Bishop Emmanuel Badejo has felicitated with Muslim faithful on this year’s occasion of Eid-el-Kabir. In his goodwill message to Muslims on Sunday, Bishop Badejo said that both Muslims and Christians should make investment for peace. The statement reads, “To my brothers and sisters in Islam, Alhamdulillahi…!!! Another Eid el-Kabir is here. I felicitate with you, as you celebrate one of the most important feasts in Islam, the feast of Sacrifice, Eid-el Kabir or Eid al-Adha as some also call it. “Prophet Ibrahim’s obedience to God, ended up as a blessing unto him. May our obedience to God in sacrifice of love and peaceful coexistence with one another bring God’s blessings and peace into our land. Amen. So shall it be if we re sincere with Almighty Allah and His ways. “What Father will ever be happy when his children cheat, oppress and kill one another? Muslims and Christians are Abraham’s children, according to the will of Allah and must all make that investment for peace lest we perish in evil and violence. God forbid that! “We must not allow a few twisted people to rubbish the identity of peace which Islam proclaims. Let us be positive and hopeful, it will be well again if we are ready to make the sacrifice. As you celebrate this great feast may the Almighty Allah accept your oblations and look with mercy on our Nation And continent. Amen.”
