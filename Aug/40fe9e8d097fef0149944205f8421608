 The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar , says there is no need to be distressed over the Supreme Court’s ruling dismissing his claims to inspect the INEC server. Speaking via his counsel, Eyitayo Jegede SAN, in a news conference after Tuesday’s proceedings, Atiku said they expected the decision and took proactive action during the hearing of the petition. “There is no cause for alarm in the decision of the apex court as it relates to our petition at the tribunal. “The issue of server was aimed at establishing that the election was rigged during the collation of results and this was thoroughly addressed through witnesses and documents tendered and admitted during the presentation of the petition.” Atiku further noted that he believes that the tribunal would do justice at the end of the day. Abubakar had filed an application at the Supreme Court seeking an order to set aside the decision of the tribunal which refused to compel INEC to allow him access to the central server allegedly used in the conduct of the presidential poll.
