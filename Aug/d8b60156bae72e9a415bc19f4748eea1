 By Segun Ayinde, Abeokuta Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, said that a joint security team that would patTherol major roads and provide adequate security for the people of South West region of the country would soon be set up. Abiodun said that the security team would consist of some members of all security agencies in the state. The governor made the disclosure while speaking at a sensitisation programme on the Vision and Focus of the State Government Towards the Preparation of the 2020 Budget held at the Obas Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Abiodun, said that the purpose of setting up the security team was to combat the menace of insecurity to protect the lives and properties of the people of the region. The governor, who lamented that the present security situation of the country was worrisome, said that the Southwest governors were working together on finding lasting solution to the menace. According to him, no serious investors would want to come to the region to invest, as the fear of insecurity of their lives and properties would stop them from coming into the region to do businesses. Abiodun also said an amended Security Trust Fund Bill would be sent to the State House of Assembly for legislative to act on to embrace major stakeholders and permit managers to take decisions without waiting for his directive. The governor, however, said that the aim of the sensitization programme was to produce a realistic budget that would focus on performance of governmentâ€™s commitment for the progress of the state.
