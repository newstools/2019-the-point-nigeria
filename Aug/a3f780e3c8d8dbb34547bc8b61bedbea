By EMMANUEL SAMUEL, YOLA The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to release all ‘political prisoners’ nation wide. Secondus, who dropped the hint in Government House Yola, Tuesday, while commiserating with the Governor of Adamawa State Hon. Ahmadu Urmaru Fintiri on the demised of his father, enjoined Adamawa people to support the governor to achieve high performance. According to him, “God has given you the best governor. It is up to you to support him.” Addressing newsmen, Secondus said there should be no room for political prisoners in a democracy. “We ask Mr President, Mr Buhari, to release political prisoners. It is not done in any political dispensation. What we are seeing today is as if we are in a military era. He should urgently release political prisoners and allow a political atmosphere and a country where there is freedom of speech,” the PDP chairman emphasized. Urging the media to take the lead, Secondus said, “I want to call on journalists and media managers not to sit on the fence. They can’t just sit and watch the country sliding. They played major role in the past, removing the country from the hands of the military. They have tempered with some among them. It is time for them to join hands with the good people of Nigeria to stand on the path of truth, on the path of democracy.” Commenting on the view of freedom of conscience that must be allowed its reign in a political environment, with particular reference to the arrest of the presidential candidate of the Africa Action Congress in the last election and convener of the RevolutionNowmovement, Omoyele Sowore, Secondus said, “The president must release political prisoners, particularly the presidential candidate of AAC, Sowore.
