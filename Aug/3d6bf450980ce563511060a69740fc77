 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Monday arraigned a businesswoman, Mrs Isabella Oshodin, on 25 counts bordering on fraud and laundering N22.9bn. She was arraigned before the Federal High Court in Abuja alongside Bob Oshodin Organisation Ltd. She pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to her before Justice Taiwo Taiwo. The EFCC told the court that Oshodin fraudulently collected N22.9bn from a former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.). Oshodin and her firm allegedly received $57.3m and N2.3bn from Dasuki. The anti-graft agency claimed that they received the money in tranches of N500m, N750m, N125m, N350m, N170m, N85m, N60m, N50m and others totalling N2.366bn. The businesswoman was accused of violating Section 15(2)(b) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended in 2012. Shortly after he was arraigned on Monday, her lawyer, Osahon Idemudia, urged the judge to grant her bail in liberal terms. The lawyer said the defendant had been in the EFCC custody for about 70 days. The EFCCâ€™s lawyer, Aisha Habib, opposed the bail application, alleging that the defendant would likely jump bail as her husband and all her children were based in the United States of America. Justice Taiwo ordered the defendant to be remanded in the EFCC custody till August 21 when ruling on her bail application would be delivered.
