 … Urges job seekers to be more vigilant The Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB, Dr. Oluremi Sopeyin has debunked a job vacancy credited to the Board as untrue, warning members of the public to be mindful of the activities of dubious individuals. Dr. Sopeyin, who issued the warning following the spread of the fake information on the social media, said that the State government is also devising means of bringing those behind the misleading information to book. According to him, the initiators of the message had requested that holders of NCE and B.Sc Education come to the SUBEB headquarters on Tuesday, August 6th, 2019 to fill forms for vacancy positions. He recalled that the message read “If you are NCE/B.Sc Edu holder, please come to SUBEB headquarters on Tuesday 6th August 2019 as the recruitment to fill the vacancies will commence. First Come, First Serve. Thanks”. Sopeyin disclosed that the government has not started recruitment of teachers, adding that the Agency will follow due process in announcing its vacancies, especially through the State government’s official website, social media platforms and other credible sources. He, therefore, advised job seekers to be more vigilant in order not to fall prey to persons with ulterior intentions who use job vacancies to swindle unsuspecting members of the public of their hard-earned money.
