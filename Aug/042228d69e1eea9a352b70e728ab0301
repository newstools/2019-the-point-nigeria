 By Nosa Akenzua, Asaba National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons has sued for collaborative efforts against trafficking. NAPTIP Director-General, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, made the call on Tuesday at a town hall meeting of stakeholders on Human Trafficking/Irregular Migration, the launch of “Not For Sale” campaign, organised in collaboration with the United KAFE Agency Institute for Development, in Asaba, Delta state, She explained that collaborative efforts in the fight against inhuman activities, would provide fruitful results for possible end to the current trend of trade by heartless traffickers. Represented by Mr. Arinze Orakwe, Director of Intelligence and Public Enlightenment at the Agency, she said the causes of human trafficking in the country has not changed, adding that only concerted efforts of all stakeholders would effect tremendous changes and arrest the ugly trend bedeviling Nigeria. “The cause of the human trafficking had not changed; deprivation, unemployment, poverty, economic, collapse in family values are some of the triggers. “This is part of the reasons why NAPTIP sees the fight as collective responsibility, it is not something government alone can do and I am glad that Delta government has set up a task force to tackle the menace. “The next thing is to encourage a free and functional education for the pupils and students so that they will have no reason not to go to school,” NAPTIP boss said. She noted that the campaign was tailored towards Edo/Delta because they have the highest number of people repatriated from Libya, but added that trafficking in all forms has become endemic, especially in other states in the country.
