The Independent National Electoral Commission has extended the collection of the Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs, which hitherto ended today, by two more days. The Chairman of the commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this on Friday, in Abuja. He was speaking at a regular meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners of INEC across the country and FCT. According to him, the meeting, coming just a week to the General Elections, was to have a final review of preparations for the elections. “In the last couple of days, we have been inundated by calls from Nigerians to review the current process of collection of Permanent Voters’ Cards. “In response, the Commission has taken the decision that the collection of PVCs scheduled to end today Friday 8th February 2019 is hereby extended nationwide to Monday 11th February 2019. This will include Saturday and Sunday. “The collection of PVCs will now take place from 9am to 6pm daily. All state offices are hereby directed to review the procedure for the collection of PVCs and dedicate all the staff of the Local Government offices to the collection process. Staff are enjoined to be civil in attending to citizens and to escalate issues that they cannot immediately resolve to their superiors,” Yakubu said.
