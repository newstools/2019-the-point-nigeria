Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri, has been offered an escape route by Roma, La Repubblica reports. Sarri was the target of angry fans on Monday night, as they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. Chants of “f*** Sarriball” could be heard around the ground during the second half. The Italian is understood to be under huge pressure at Chelsea and could even lose his job as soon as Sunday, if his side are beaten by Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final. It is however understood he could be set for a return to Serie A. Sarri reportedly met with Roma chief Franco Baldini for dinner in London earlier this week, to discuss the potential switch. Current Roma boss Eusebio Di Francesco’s future is unclear, with sporting director Monchi strongly linked with an exit from the Giallorossi.
