The Vice-Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, has hailed the institution’s male soccer team for emerging champions at the inaugural African Students Football Union 2019 
tournament. The 2019 ASFU championship held recently at Adamasingba Stadium, Ibadan, Oyo State, on 
January 27. Team LASU became the overall winner of the championship after defeating the West African University Games champions from the University of Development Services, Ghana. Following the victory, LASU will represent Africa at the World Universities Football Competition holding in Russia later this year. Fagbohun said the victory proved that the university’s steady rise to the 
summit of league of universities in Nigeria was not a fluke, adding, “This shows that what we can do in academics, as clearly expressed in our status as Africa Centre of Excellence, we can also do in 
sports. “Your victory at the tournament is not for Lagos State only, but for Nigeria as a whole. I want to assure you that the university management will give you all the necessary support as you will be representing Africa at the world stage in Russia later this year.” Other institutions, which participated in the competition, are: Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria; University of Kenyatta, Kenya; Edo State University and Tai Solarin University of Education, 
Ijebu-ode.
