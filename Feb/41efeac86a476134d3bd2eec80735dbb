President Muhammadu Buhari has said he cannot remove Mahmood Yakubu as the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, because he would need a resolution by two-thirds majority of the Senate to do so. There has been speculations that Buhari was set to remove the INEC boss, following the abrupt postponement of the general elections. However, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, insisted there was no truth in such claims. “Those reports are utterly baseless and false. There is nothing like that. “Whoever is saying the President is removing INEC chairman is just displaying his illiteracy. Let him go and read the constitution. “You need a resolution by two-thirds majority of the Senate for any such action,” Shehu said according to The Nation. INEC moved the general elections to Saturday, February 23, about six hours to the start of the polls on the original date of February 16.
