Senator Rafiu Ibrahim has insisted that he remains the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Kwara South Senatorial District in the forthcoming election, despite claims by the Independent National Electoral Commission to the contrary. The lawmaker spoke on Wednesday while addressing party members and supporters in Ilemona, headquarters of Oyun Local Government Area, where he hails from. He explained that INEC erroneously published the name of Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed as the PDP Kwara South Senatorial Candidate, insisting that the governor had voluntarily withdrawn from the 
race. Ibrahim, therefore, told his supporters not to entertain any fear, stressing that the mistake would soon be corrected by the electoral body. He expressed appreciation to Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed for acceding to the request by Ibolo leaders on ceding the party’s Kwara south senatorial ticket to Ibolo axis of the zone. Rafiu urged the people of Oyun and Kwara to vote the PDP at all levels in the coming election, saying that if Alhaji Atiku Abubakar was voted as Nigeria’s next president, his (Atiku) administration would be of immense benefits to Kwara and Nigeria at large. PDP leaders, who were present at the event, included: the Oyun Local Government Chairman, Hon Joshua Omokanye; Oyun PDP Chairman, Alhaji Degomina; House of Assembly member, Hon. Sikirat Anako; Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development who is also the PDP state Assembly candidate for Odo-Ogun, Hon. Muideen Alalade; and his counterpart for Oke-Ogun, Alhaji Tijani Olaegbe, among 
others.
