President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to probe the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEac) over the postponement of last Saturday’s elections. Speaking on Monday in Abuja at a caucus meeting  of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the rescheduled election, the president said the electoral body has to answers some questions after the general elections While expressing surprise at the INEC’s disappointment, President Buhari said the electoral umpire had all the time and all the resources they wanted and didn’t have to wait for only six hours to cancel the elections. He said, “Definitely, the reason why such incompetence manifested has to be explained to the Nation after the elections, we have to know exactly what happened and who is responsible. Otherwise, our efforts to make sure that this system is acceptable would have been eroded. “The constitution and the law protected INEC. But they must not take us for granted. If for example, the National Assembly refused to approve what they wanted, INEC would have had moral reasons why they couldn’t perform. “If the time of four years of election was not constitutionally obeyed the government, INEC would have a case. But we don’t understand the reason for this inefficiency and we have to go into details after the election to find out who is responsible.”
