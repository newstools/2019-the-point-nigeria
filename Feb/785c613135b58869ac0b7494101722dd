The Debt Management Office says the Federal Government’s February bonds received over N234 billion from investors for the N150 billion that was offered. A statement obtained from the DMO showed that the auction had three instruments, for five, seven and 10-year tenors. “Total bids received from investors for the bonds exceeded N234 billion, with a total subscription level of 156 per cent. The focus of investors was principally on the 10-year bond which had a subscription level of 392 per cent. “Successful bids were allotted at rates notably lower than those at the January auction, with 14.52 per cent for the five year, 14.79 per cent for the seven year and 14.93 per cent for the 10-year bond.” It added that the DMO allotted the full N150 billion offered to successful bidders across the three tenors. According to the statement, the over subscription was a continuous trend, judging from the N197 billion subscription it got for N150 billion offered in January. However, N116.98 billion was allotted in January. A breakdown of the auction results for February which was also obtained from the Debt Office, the five year paper had N9.52 billion subscriptions, but N1.50 billion was allotted, the seven year had N28.85 billion subscriptions, but N12.25 billion was allotted.
