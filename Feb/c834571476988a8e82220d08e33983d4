A candidate of the Action Democratic Party for Osun  West senatorial District, Hon. Dotun Babayemi and some agents of political parties in Ward 2, units one and two at St. Peter’s Primary School, Gbongan in Osun state have decried the absence of security personnel at the voting centres. Speaking with our correspondent, Babayemi, who had cast his vote said despite the absence of security officers, elections were going peacefully. He asked security agencies and Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure that accredited security personnel were drafted to the polling units. “From my observations this morning, a couple of security units in Gbongan have no security officers. This is not good. Although elections have been going on smoothly and peacefully,” he said. When asked on the chances of his party to coast home to victory, Babayemi said ADP would win by landslide. He said, “we have won these elections, we are only waiting for announcement of the results. ADP is a party to beat and I only want to urge our supporters to stay with their votes and ensure they count.” Also speaking in the same vein, agents of the Peoples Democratic Party, All Progressives Congress, ADP, complained of absence of security personnel at their polling units. Meanwhile, checks by our correspondent who visited the polling units at 9:40am on Saturday revealed that there was just a police man at the two units. When asked where his colleagues were, the policeman who was wearing an INEC security tag, said other security personnel drafted to the polling units were on mufti.
