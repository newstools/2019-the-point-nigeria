The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  has decried the directive by the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government to shut down the venue for its Presidential campaign mega rally in Abuja billed for Saturday, as an act of desperation, but stated that nothing can stop it from rallying in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).The party in a press release issued Friday and signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan  said : “It may interest Nigerians to know that the PDP duly paid and secured permission to host our mega rally at the Old Parade Ground, in Garki Area of Abuja, only for the officials of the facility to inform our party this morning that they have been “ordered” to shut down the venue and frustrate our mega rally for no just cause. “Such resort to self-help further exposes the irredeemable insensitivity of the Buhari Presidency and the APC.“The overwhelming popularity of the peoples candidate, Atiku Abubakar, which points to an imminent crushing defeat that awaits President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 16, Presidential election has pushed the Buhari Presidency into a panic mode.“President Buhari has always been disheartened and jittery over spontaneous mammoth crowd of Nigerians at Atiku Abubakar’s rallies across the country, leading to the desperation to frustrate our rallies, resort to smear campaigns, vandalizing of our campaign materials and denial of venues, in APC controlled states, as was the case in Kano state recently. “President Buhari is frustrated because he has failed in governance and as such, has no message for Nigerians. President Buhari daily continues to lose followership, in millions, to Atiku Abubakar; for which his handlers have now resorted to renting people for his rallies, including Nigerien thugs.  “The Buhari Presidency and APC would soon realize that the more they fight Atiku Abubakar, the more Nigerians are spurred to queue behind him as the rallying point in their quest to return our nation to the path of national cohesion and economic prosperity.” The PDP therefore charges President Buhari not to allow his handlers to further pitch him against Nigerians with this contemptible shut down of the venue of the PDP Presidential campaign rally in Abuja, as such is a direct assault on the sensibilities and aspiration of Nigerians across the board”.
