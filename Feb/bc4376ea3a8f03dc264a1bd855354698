Civil societies organisations under the umbrella of Civil Societies Coalition for the Emancipation of Osun State (CSCEOS) have called for the immediate removal of the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahummud Yakub, saying he had shown gross incompetence and bias in the handling of his responsibility to the country. Speaking with our correspondent on the telephone, the chairman of CSCEOS, Comrade Adeniyi Suleiman, said INEC had made the nation a laughing stock before the international community hence, should be sacked as the Commission’s head. He said Nigerians could no longer trust the electoral body under the leadership of Yakub saying that his replacement with a neutral person would go a long way in restoring the trust and confidence of Nigerians in INEC. Suleiman alleged that majority of the INEC commissioners and other personnel had been compromised. According to him, CSCEOS may mobilise a mass protest to demand the sack of Yakub. With the current INEC boss, he said, “INEC is no more independent. “Prof. Mahummud Yakub is not competent to be the chairman of INEC. INEC is no more independent because it has been under the control of the Federal Government. People are tired already. INEC communicated with some people in Aso Rock before postponing the elections. “I live in Lagos and I have to travel to Osun State to vote but I am now stranded. We are not happy. The elections were postponed because they want to map out strategies to rig. We don’t have confidence in INEC again. They have collected bribes and can no longer be trusted. “The postponement is unwarranted and illegal with a serious dent on the image of the country before the international community. This is a monumental mess and we will not allow it to continue unchecked. We are, therefore, going to mobilise Nigerians legally to make a peaceful protests across the country calling for the removal of INEC chairman”.
