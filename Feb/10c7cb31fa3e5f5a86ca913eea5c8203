The Independent National Electoral Commission and the All Progressives Congress has been dragged to court by the Peoples Democratic Party over the alleged participation of Foreigners in Nigeriaâ€™s Elections. This suit is coming shortly after the participation of governors from Niger Republic at a rally of the APC in Kano state recently. The PDP also joined in the suit as first and third defendants are the Nigerian Immigration Service and the minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau. The party is asking the court to determine whether foreigners can participate either directly or indirectly in the general elections in Nigeria with regards to the provision of section 12 of the electoral Act 2010 and paragraph 2 of the 2019 INEC regulations and guidelines. It also demanded to know whether it is contrary to Nigerian law and public policy for foreigners to participate in the campaign rally of a Nigerian political party. The opposition party is requesting for the court to declare that foreigners cannot participate either directly or indirectly in the general elections of Nigeria with regard to the provision of section 12 of the electoral act 2010. The PDP also wants the court to issue an order directing the Nigerian Immigration Service and the minister of interior to ensure that foreigners do not participate in the 2019 general elections.
