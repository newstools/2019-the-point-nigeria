A middle- aged man, Eze Iheanacho,   who hails from Amaiye community of Imo State has fled Nigeria for fears of being killed to appease the family god which he has declined to be its leading worshipper. In 2002 , Eze Iheanacho, the first child of his father in Nwa- Agbara family, was expected to take charge of the family’s deity, Chukwu Abiama, but having received Jesus Christ,  and now being a born- again Christian, declined to take the position. It was gathered that for his refusal to be the leading worshipper of the  family deity,  he was to be sacrificed and his blood used to appease the god by the community LeadersTo escape being killed and sacrificed , Iheneacho was said to have fled his village to  take refuge with a friend in  Benin City, the Edo State capital. He was said to have secured  a job later and settled down but was however living in perpetual fear of attack on  being  located by his kinsmen from his village who have been instructed to look for him and forcibly bring him home to either worship the deity or be killed.Few years after settling down in Benin, he got information from his sister that his father died as a result of the shock of his action and that his family members were desperately looking for him to pay the supreme price for his action. Sensing that the family members  had got the wind of his sojourn in Benin and were mobilising towards getting him arrested and forced him home to sacrifice him to appease the family god, Iheanacho was said to have travelled out of the country with his exact whereabouts unknown. It would be recalled that some people have lost their lives for refusing to perform the role of a leading worshipper of their family deities in the South Eastern part of the country where Iheneacho comes from.
