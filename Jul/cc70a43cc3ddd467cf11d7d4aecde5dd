 Two justices of the Supreme Court have delivered dissenting judgments and upheld Senator Ademola Adeleke as winner of the Osun governorship election. Justices Adamu Galinje and Kumai Akaahs held that Senator Adeleke scored the majority votes in the September 22 governorship election and fulfilled the constitutional requirement to be declared winner. Justice Galinje held that nullifying the proceedings of the Election Petitions Tribunal on the grounds of the absence of Justice Peter Obiorah on only the proceedings of February 6th without a certified true copy of the original record of the proceedings tendered before the appellate court is “mere conjecture” .
