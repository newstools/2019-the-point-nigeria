By Haulat Afolabi Following the victory of the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, at the Supreme Court, his Kogi counterpart, Yahaya Bello, has described the development as an assurance of a true democracy in the country. Bello enjoined Governor Oyetola to extend hands of fellowship to his opponents and ensure that the state got purposeful leadership. “I have been in election tribunals down to the Supreme Court and can attest to the level of distraction a governor and his administration face on account of some needless litigations. But a calm disposition, open-mindedness and inclusiveness towards everybody, including those who instituted litigations against you, is what defines a true leader,” Bello said. He , however, implored Oyetola to ensure that he justified the victory by being a good ambassador of the All Progressives Congress while sustaining the programmes and developmental agenda of his state in line with the party’s manifesto. He said after all the legal tussles, the lesson was to ensure that the citizens were repaid with good governance, which he said was a proof that their confidence in their leader was not misplaced.
