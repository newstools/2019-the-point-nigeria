 By SEGUN AYINDE, ABEOKUTA Police in Ogun State have arrested a 37-year-old fake soldier, Muhammad Yakub for allegedly using the Nigeria military uniform to exploit unknown members of the public. The suspect was said to have bought the army uniform for N2,500 after he was dismissed from the military in 2016 for refusing to go to Maiduguri to fight Boko Haram insurgency. Yakub was among the numbers of suspects paraded by the state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama at the Police Headquarters Eleweran, Abeokuta, whose crimes range from cultism, robbery, car snatching among others. The suspect said that he was arrested by the police for impersonating when he put on the army uniform to board a bus for free from Lagos to Kano. He said he did that because he did not have any transport fare. He however regretted his action and denied ever impersonating the military by putting on the uniform to exploit the public. He said “I was on my way to Kano and I did not have transport fare, so I decided to put on this (military uniform) so that I can get there.” “I have not been impersonating, had it been I had been doing it, nemesis would have caught up with me long time. “I am a dismissed soldier and I bought this uniform for N2,500. I was dismissed in 2016, we were 2,016 in numbers who refused to go to Maduguri to fight Boko Haram” he added.
