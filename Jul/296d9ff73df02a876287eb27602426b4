  By PRISCILLA DENNIS, MINNA The Niger State House of Assembly has resolved to swear in the elected member representing Agaie Constituency, Hon. Yahaya Abdullahi of the Peoples Democratic Party. The members unanimously took the decision during its executive session to swear him in at its next sitting. Making the disclosure at a press conference on Friday, in Minna, the Speaker of the Assembly, Hon Abdullahi Bawa Wuse said it has become necessary for him to clear the air on the issue as a result of the crisis that broke out at Agaie local government over alleged rumour that the House is not prepared to swear him in. It would be recalled that the people of Agaie and the members of the PDP, went on protest demanding why Hon. Abdullahi of the PDP was not sworn in at the Assembly’s last sitting. Speaking on the protest in Agaie, Wuse said, “To me, this is quite unfortunate and to me its quite uncivilized, because I expect that if there is anything, they should get back to us, instead of going to ventilate their minds that way, they can go back to the court and tell the court that the House has refused to swear in the Agaie member.” Wuse explained that after coming to the leadership of the house on the issue and were told to exercise a little patience that it would be resolved, they ought not to have gone on protest. According to him, “House of Assembly is convinced beyond no reasonable doubt to go ahead unanimously to swear in the Agaie elected member, am very concern about getting this issue over” he stated.
