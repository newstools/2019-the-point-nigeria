 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The senator representing Osun East, Prince Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi has accused some members of the host communities in Southwest of conspiring with Fulani herdsmen to cause havoc. Fadahunsi said the only way out of the rampaging kidnappers and bandits is for indigenes to stop giving support to the herdsmen perpetrating the heinous act. The senator disclosed this while speaking at the 2019 Police Community Relations committee week in Osogbo, the Osun state capital. He maintained that the herdsmen and bandits carry out their nefarious act through the conspiracy of indigenes of host communities. Represented by Prophet Tosin Odeyemi, Fadahunsi said “until we deal with our unruly children who are greedy and want sudden wealth, the problem will stay with us.” Delivering a paper on kidnapping and banditry, Fadahunsi, who was the chairman of the occasion, urged traditional rulers to be discrete in the sales of land and tame their appetite for material things that encourages the indiscriminate sales of lands to strangers, who could be agents of criminals. The Senator also called on the police to encourage community policing, noting that the citizen or residents know the terrain more than the police and can assist both in prevention and crime fighting.
