…as Pepe’s arrival may limit playing time  Super Eagles midfielder Alex Iwobi may be enjoying a fine run at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, but news coming out from France indicates that his club Arsenal have submitted a bid of 70 million pounds for the signature of Lille forward Nicolas Pepe. That is usually good news for anyone connected with the Gunners but the possible arrival of the Ivorian could spell limited playing time for the Nigerian who is deployed on either side of the attack by manager Unai Emery. Fight for places for the Arsenal front three is likely to be intense next season and should Pepe arrive at the club that could see as much as five players competing for two slots on the flanks with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Iwobi. French broadcaster TFI in their weekend programme, Telefoot, reported the news and informed that officials of Lille are now considering the offer. The Nigerian international made 22 starts in the league during Emery’s first year in charge, operating primarily on the left wing although made few appearances from the right wing or centrally when the head coach rested a number of first team players for Cup competitions. Pepe was on the losing Ivorian side that exited the Africa Cup of Nations in the quarterfinals stage in the hands of Algeria.
