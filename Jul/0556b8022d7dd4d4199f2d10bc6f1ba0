 Kano state Correspondent Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists has congratulated Alhaji Ghali Sadiq for his well-deserved appointment as the Managing-Director, Radio Kano. The Chapel also congratulated one of its members, Lawal Sabo Ibrahim, for his re-appointment as the Managing-Director of the Triumph Newspapers. The Chapel’s chairman, Comrade Ibrahim Garba Shuaibu, in a statement made available to The Point, described Sabo Ibrahim as a well-groomed senior journalist, editor and media resource person, who was once a member of Kano state Correspondent Chapel, from where he grew to the top, edited and managed a number of national newspapers, before he was called to resuscitate the once moribund Triumph Newspapers. Shuaibu noted, “In the same vein, having served as the Managing Director of Radio Kano during the tenure of Senator Ibrahim Shekarau as Governor of Kano state, we have no doubt in our mind that Alhaji Ghali Sadiq will bring his wealth of experience to bear in the quest to reposition the state-owned radio station and push it to the front-pew of world-class broadcast best practices. “The ace broadcaster, who has worked in a number of radio stations, was also a member of Kano state Correspondent Chapel, when he served as a Correspondent with Radio Nigeria, Kaduna. “We sincerely appreciate His Excellency, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje for appointing core professionals and seasoned journalists to man the affairs of Kano state-owned media outfits. We wish them well in their new assignments and pray to Allah to grant them the grace and wisdom to succeed,” Shuaibu said.
