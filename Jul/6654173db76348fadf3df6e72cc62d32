 By Samuel Fasua National President of Change Agent Foundation International, Mr. Dipo Okeyomi, has clarified the position of the organisation, saying it is a welfare group made up of vibrant young men and women in the All Progressives Congress. Speaking in an interview with The Point, Okeyomi dismissed speculations that the group was being sponsored by the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; former Osun State governor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, and the national chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomole. “I laughed when I read that these great leaders of our party are sponsoring us to unseat some governors. “No, nobody is sponsoring us; and in fact, these gentlemen know little or nothing about our modus operandi. We are in APC to ensure that all our public office holders live up to expectation, thereby helping to grow the party and improve on the welfare of the people.” Okeyomi also said the CAFI had no apologies on its determination to show the Kogi State governor, Mr. Yahaya Bello, and his Ondo State counterpart, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, the exit door, through the APC primary elections. “We believe that our great party should not go to the market with wares that cannot sell. Both Bello and Akeredolu are not sellable, and that is what we have been drumming to the hearing of our members,” he averred. Okeyomi noted that the APC, through the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, had redefined party politics in Nigeria through its superlative performance and internal mechanism that make its members to be disciplined, and dedicated. “So anybody who does not want to yield to these great qualities should never be fielded for any position by our party,” he stressed.
