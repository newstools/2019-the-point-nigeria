The main opposition political party in the country, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that it is not bothered by the high turnout of people at rallies organised by the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), saying the crowd that attends the APC campaign rallies will not transform to victory for the party in the February 16 presidential election and other elections on March 2, 2019. Speaking with The Point in Abuja recently, the Director, Media and Publicity of the PDP Campaign Organisation, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, said Nigerians had made up their minds on voting for Atiku Abubakar as their next president come rain or shine. He said the huge crowd of people seen at the APC rallies was rented stressing that the party had been deceiving itself and not Nigerians. He said, “You know in Yoruba land there is a proverb that when a farmer lies that he has 200 heaps of yams but actually has 100 at harvest he will later realise that he is only deceiving himself. A day of reckoning is near and APC will realise it is fooling itself. “Since Oshiomhole came into office, APC has been losing grounds across the country; it has resorted to renting crowd at its presidential rallies to create false impression that President Buhari, who has been rejected by Nigerians, still commands followership in our country. “We know how the Buhari Presidency has sunk low to be paying money to people to attend its rallies; how the Presidency and the APC are recruiting agents in various parts of the country, through whom they conduit renting fees ranging from N5,000 to N10,000 per head at President Buhari’s rally which is now the latest racket in town. “These agents transport the rented crowd in buses and trailers from neighboring states to venues of President Buhari’s rallies to give the impression of massive support from the host state. Usually, the same individuals are recycled in rallies especially in a particular geo-political zone”, Ologbondiyan said.
