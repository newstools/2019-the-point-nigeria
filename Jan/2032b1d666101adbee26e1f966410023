The Rilwan Adesoji Akanbi Foundation has promised to take health care to the desired level in Oyo State. Speaking to a cross-section of medical practitioners and Oyo State indigenes, in Ibadan, at the weekend, the lawmaker representing Oyo South Senatorial District, in the National Assembly, Senator Adesoji Akanbi, decried the lackadaisical attitude of the current state government as regards health issues in the state. The senator said, in furtherance of his efforts at ensuring affordable health care, especially for the less privileged in the society, he would ensure that Oyo State indigenes got the best in the country in terms of health care. He appreciated the indigenes for their support in his four years in the Senate and urged them to exercise their civic rights without fear to ensure the continuity of laudable projects by voting for him under the platform of the African Democratic Congress. “We will continue the good work that we have started. I am happy that many people here have come with testimonies of what they have gained from the Foundation. Seeing smiles on the faces of the less privileged gives me joy, and I promise that we will step up our reach, even beyond this level, when we are re-elected to represent the good people of Oyo South,” he said.
