The Peoples Democratic Party has dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies to the European Union over the appointment of Amina Zakari, as head of the presidential election collation centre. In an interactive session with EU Election Observation Mission in Nigeria, the spokesman of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan question the All Progressives Congress led administration for what he called party’s poor governance scorecard since it came into power in 2015. The former ruling party expressed worry over the continued presence of Amina Zakari in INEC, and also questioned the neutrality of the electoral umpire and security agencies in the general election. Ologbondiyan said that “Amina Zakari should not be found anywhere near the process. We have made our position known to INEC because there will be a direct conflict of interest.” The party condemned the use of security agents in the past elections conducted under the watch of President Buhari. He added, “we believe that election should be free and fair. PDP subscribed to all the tenets of democracy. “President Muhammadu Buhari is paying lip service to free, fair and transparent election. “He refused to assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill. “We are convinced that the President was never prepared for free and fair election. PDP as a party does not believe in violence, but would like the Presidency and INEC to conduct free and fair election. Outside of this, we will not agree.”
