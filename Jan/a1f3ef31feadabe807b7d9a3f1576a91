Kaduna State Governor,  Nasir El-rufai,   has said if he were to be Walter Onnoghen, the embattled Chief Justice of Nigeria being prosecuted for failing to declare his assets, he would step aside. The North western Nigeria state governor stated this on Thursday when he featured at Sunrise Daily, a programme aired on Channels Television. “I am extremely sad about this Chief Justice matter, I am very said about it because if I am the Chief Justice and I write and said yes I have these assets, I have these bank accounts but did not declare them, I would not even allow the CCB to file charges. I will resign there and then to protect the institution that I head,” El-rufai said. “Because the admission that I did not declare my assets, that infraction alone is enough for him to step down and protect the institution. “All this court orders and lawyers and all these is not helping the judiciary, the legal profession and Nigeria,” the governor said. The Chief Justice is accused for allegedly omitting to declare his assets and illegally operating five domiciliary accounts in various foreign currencies. The charges were filed by the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) on the orders of Abubakar Malami, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF). Onnoghen is to be arraigned at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). As the matter was called up at the CCT on Monday, the top jurist was absent, challenging the jurisdiction to try him. He was represented by over 40 Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) and some lawyers. Later in the day, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja halted the arraignment of the jurist.
