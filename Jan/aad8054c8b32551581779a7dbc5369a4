Financial experts and capital market operators have advised investors on the shares of Diamond Bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc and Custodian Investment Plc for the weeks ahead.
The three most traded stocks, during last week, measured by volume, accounted for 465.000 million shares, worth N2.044 billion in 2,448 deals, contributing 36.75 per cent and 14.53 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively.
Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, Heritage Investment Limited, Mr. Abimbola Kazeem, said the performance of the stock market over the years, underscored the fact that it was not delinked from the macro economy, saying that “it has witnessed boom and burst cycles in response to oil price volatility.”
 “Given the country’s mono product economy, the market has been bullish for most of the time, following rising oil prices, and bearish when oil prices decline. The banking industry remains the most active sector, therefore investors are advised to make an informed decision when choosing active stocks,” he added.
Prof. Sheriffdeen Tella of the Department of Economics, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, said the market had not really grown over the years in terms of modus operandi.
Tella said the market had moved from analogue to digitised operations, but was still shallow in terms of the number and the calibre of firms that were listed on it.
“Most firms on the stock exchange are local rather than international. So, there is the need to reform the Exchange to attract or encourage listing by foreign or international businesses to increase its depth,” Tella said.
