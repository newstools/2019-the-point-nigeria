The LP said it became evident that the APC was desperate to rig the forthcoming election, noting that the allegations of corruption against Onnoghen was suspicious. The LP Chairman in Ogun State, Comrade Abayomi Arabambi, who spoke with our correspondent recently, said the planned trial of the  Chief Justice was unconstitutional. He urged the Federal Government to tread with caution on the allegations levelled against him, saying, rather than going about things the wrong way, the Federal Government should use constitutional means to press home the allegations. He accused the FG of engaging in questionable actions, insisting that such was “a ploy by the APC government of Buhari to replace him with a new acting CJN for their victory at the election petition tribunal should the opposition parties challenge APC victory at the election petition tribunal. The LP chairman, who noted that Onnoghen’s case was not properly addressed, faulted Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s claim that the president was not aware of the CJN’s case before the Code of Conduct Tribunal, saying the VP’s statement showed that Buhari was not capable of ruling the country
