The wife of the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mrs Titi Abubakar has urged Nigerians to vote for her husband at the forthcoming polls in order to be liberated from what she described as the quagmire the APC-led government has plunged the country into. Mrs Titi Abubakar  stated this in Akure, the Ondo State capital while canvassing support for her husband, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar at the PDP secretariat in the state, emphasized that a vote for her husband would ensure that the country works again. “We’re in bondage, nothing seems to be working again in Nigeria, vote Atiku to liberate us. “It’s an inclusive government that we are going to have because it would be the government by the people and for the people. “We want to be the servant of our people because we are the chosen one.” The wife of the former Vice President further stated that unemployment has pushed most youths into criminal activities, assuring that as a job creator and an employer of labour, Atiku would replicate this to turn around the country’s economy. She noted that the present administration in the country had plunged Nigeria into economic crisis, insecurity, massive poverty and unemployment, making life difficult for the common man, but said, “all these will be a thing of the past. “Atiku is a job creator, he is an employer of labour and he will replicate this to turn around the country economy. “This man has been tested and trusted. He was there as the Vice President before and he will do it again. “His experience from the public and private sector will be put into practice. “He played a key role in the former President Obasanjo’s economic team, the eight years with President Obasanjo was meaningful to Nigeria and Atiku will do it again. She, however, urged the people to obtain their Permanent Voters Card saying, “this is the visa to send this administration out of office and usher in a new dawn in Nigeria.”
