 A23 -year-old man, GoodNews Abel, has allegedly defiled a six-year-old girl at Number 10, Dendeke Street,Â  Bariga, Lagos.   The suspect, who is a neighbour to the victim, lives with his mother in a two-room apartment.   It was gathered that the 23-year-old carried out the nefarious act while his mother was away from home.   The little girl and his brother reportedly went to the suspected rapist's apartment to play. A few minutes later, the victim's bother left his sister (name withheld) behind.   The suspect was alleged to have taken advantage of the unsuspecting young girl, who was watching a movie with him on the bed.   He was said to have dropped the window blind and brought the girl's shoes into the room so that his neighbour would not suspect that she was with him.   After forcefully defiling the girl, he warned her not to tell anybody but her parents later got to know about it as the girl started acting strangely.   He was arrested by the police for questioning.   The suspect claimed that he was lured into the act when the girl started playing with him.   He said he tried to insert his manhood into the girl's private part but that he could not penetrate.   He pleaded for forgiveness and promised never to do such a thing again.   Detectives attached to the Bariga Police Division have arrested the suspect.   Our reporter learnt that the suspect had been transfered to the Gender Unit of the Lagos State Police Command.
