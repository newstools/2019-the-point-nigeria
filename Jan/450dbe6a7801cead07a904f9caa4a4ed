The National Youth Service Corps has warned corps members to be non-partisan in their conduct in the forthcoming general elections in Gombe state. Mr David Markson, the state NYSC Coordinator, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Gombe on Thursday. He said the corps members had been successfully trained on the successful conduct of the election. He also implored them to be non-partisan and of good behaviour during the election as well as to adhere strictly to the stipulated guidelines. “We all must be nonpartisan and the NYSC band must not by any chance be used by individuals or group for political rally. “As the general election draws nearer, the NYSC field officers have been directed to educate corps members on what is expected of them during the exercise. “In Gombe state, we have successfully trained corps members and reminded them of the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between us and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “The NYSC has collaborated well with INEC and conducted successful elections in the past and this time around we are ready to conduct a successful exercise,” he said. He further urged traditional and religious leaders to enlighten their followers on the need to treat corps members fairly to enable them conduct a successful election.
