 AYO ESAN,
ABUJA The Peoples’
Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has expressed
sadness over the tragic crash of the Nigeria Air Force helicopter, resulting in
the death of five of our gallant soldiers fighting insurgency in the North
East. The party in
a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan
Friday noted that “these patriotic Nigerians risked and ultimately laid down
their lives for our nation, while providing close air support to troops of 145
Battalion, Damasak in Borno state who have continued to display unmatched
courage in the fight against insurgents. “Our
party deeply appreciates and salutes the courage, gallantry and sacrifice of
our troops, many of whom have paid the ultimate price risk their lives to keep
the entire nation safe in defending our nation and ensuring our safety. “The
PDP, therefore, condoles with our military high command, the families of the
victims of the crash, as well as those of other soldiers who have died while
protecting our nation. “While
praying God to console the bereaved, the PDP called for more support, equipment
and prayers for our soldiers as they daily.”
