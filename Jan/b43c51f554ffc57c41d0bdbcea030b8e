The Minister of Transportation and Director General of the All Progressives Congress Campaign Organization, Chibuike Amaechi, has said that the ruling party has closed all rigging avenue even against itself. According to Amaechi, President Muhammadu Buhari did not do very well in 2015 in terms of votes he recorded because the Peoples Democratic Party, rigged the election. He said come February, Buhari will win the 2019 presidential election with even a better margin compared to 2015. Amaechi, a former governor of Rivers State, told Daily Trust that he has no doubt President Buhari will perform better in 2019 even as he assured the APC won’t be involved in election rigging. “We will do better in 2019. A part of the 2015 election was rigged by PDP. But this time we are closing all rigging against even ourselves. “If you speak to the President, one of the things he says is that he wants to bequeath to Nigerians the ability to choose their leaders and be held accountable for the weakness and strength of those leaders. “So you don’t elect a leader for them and say they are responsible for the failures of the leader. The president is determined to do that,” he said. The Minister also said the ruling APC will not be using the security agencies or its incumbency status to influence the elections. He also said Mr. President will be on the campaign train of the APC despite handing his campaign responsibilities to Mr. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Co-Chairman of the MBCO. “The PDP strategy is clear. Our strategy is clear. PDP says our people are hungry and the economy is bad. We have our replies. The first reply is that Nigerians are hungry because PDP carted away all the money. “If they left the money, we would have managed it in a way that Nigerians will have food to eat. What creates food is what creates job. If you create job, you create food. But you don’t create jobs when there are no resources,” he said.
