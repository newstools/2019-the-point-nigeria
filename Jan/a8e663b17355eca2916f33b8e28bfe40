Aformer Chairman, Association of Local Governments of Nigeria, Katsina State, Ibrahim Dankaba, who is the fourth defendant in the ongoing trial of ex-Governor Shema and three others accused of alleged misappropriation of about N11billion state’s funds, has insisted that he made statements to EFCC under duress. Other defendants in the case include a former Commissioner for Local Government Affairs in the state, Sani Makana, and the then Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Lawal 
Rufai. According to him, he was invited by the EFCC on January 25, 2016 and October 31, 2016 for an interview. Dankaba told the court that he went to EFCC with his counsel, Aliyu Ahmed Yola, but the latter was asked to stay outside. He said he had sought to present Mr. Yola as second witness but the prosecution objected, claiming that a counsel could not be a witness at the same time unless he withdrew as counsel. “A counsel cannot turn into a witness in the case unless he withdraws as counsel,” Mr. O I Uket (SAN), prosecution counsel, said. However, defence counsel, Mr Uyi Ugunma, said Mr Yola stopped appearing as counsel in the case since it was clear that he would stand to testify. He cited Section 175 of the Evidence Act (1), which explains that nothing disqualifies the client from being a witness since he had withdrawn as counsel.The judge overruled the prosecution and allowed Yola to testify. In his testimony, Yola said he accompanied his client to the EFCC on January 25, and October 31, 2016, but was asked to leave. He said he drew their attention on the fundamental human rights of his client but was denied the 
request. According to Yola, his client was detained in EFCC custody for 23 days, during which he was prevented from rendering services to
 him. The judge, Justice Ibrahim Maikaita, adjourned the case to Feb. 18, 2019.
