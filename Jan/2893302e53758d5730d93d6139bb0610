Keystone Bank has floated ‘Keystone Bank Mobile App’ with zero data, which will enable customers of the bank to transact banking services at their convenience.
The feature, which is another first from the bank and in the Nigerian banking sector, enables customers to enjoy banking services on their mobile phones without data.
 Group Managing Director/CEO of Keystone Bank Limited, Dr. Obeahon Ohiwerei, said the development was in demonstration of the bank’s commitment to delivering superior and innovative banking solutions to its customers.
He said, “In our fast-paced and evolving digital world, service literally has to be at the speed of thought; the rules of engagement are changing so fast that customer expectations are as diverse as our lifestyles and choices.
“It is no longer a question of stepping out to the bank but about the convergence of innovative services, digital technology and Omni-channel platforms coming to us at breakneck speed.
“Mobile Banking for one isn’t entirely new in the industry, but there is no end to innovation in delivering customer convenience; at Keystone Bank, that’s what sets us apart and that shall continue to be our strength.”
