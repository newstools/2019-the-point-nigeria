 Awoman identified simply as Mrs Onyemaechi reportedly escaped death by the whiskers, recently, when some hoodlums attacked her and her husband on thier way from church, along the Lagos- Badagry expressway, Lagos.   It was learnt that the woman lost her pregnancy in the incident.   Mrs Onyemaechi and Chuks, her husband, who rode in a private vehicle belonging to their family friend, were waylaid by the robbers at Oluti bus 
stop.   The couple said they were attacked by three men on board a motorcycle after disembarking from their friend’s vehicle and headed home.   Her husband said one of the men pulled out a gun and pointed it at his head.   The eight months pregnant woman was allegedly stabbed in the neck with a dagger by one of the hoodlums while appealing to them not to kill her 
husband.   The man said, “They stabbed my wife in the neck. She preferred to die instead of me but our baby paid the supreme sacrifice as we lost our first baby to the incident. My wife bled so much; I was crying as I prayed for her survival. I could not bear it. I didn't know what to 
do.   “I handed my handset to the robbers, my wife’s mobile phone too and the N600 left with me. They still tried to attack me but one of them ordered that they should leave me. He knew I had no money left. He said, madam sorry o. Let’s leave 
here.   “The robbery operation did not last more than one minute. It was a horrible sight. My wife was bleeding so much; I screamed but there was nobody around. I had to lift her until I saw someone who parked his mini-bus and moved her to a private hospital at Satellite.   After the first aid treatment, they referred us to the general hospital. We lost the baby.  I’m praying for her recovery now.”
