 Despite the big contest expected to occur between President Muhamadu Buhari and former vice president Atiku Abubarkar on February 19, the duo have been pitched to slug it out in what look like a pre-election contest. In the contest, Daar award 2019, the political bigwigs will be seen vying for the award of man of the year at the political category of the award. Other popular Nigerians in the contest with the duo include Aliko Dangote and Chief Justice Onnoghen. DAAR Awards 2019 is put together by DAAR Communications as part of their corporate social responsibility and commitment to promoting excellence in Africa. The award ceremony which is slated for January 19 at International Conference Centre, Abuja is expected to feature several bigwigs in the political arena, entertainment cocoon, and others. For instance, in the breakout star of the year award category in entertainment, the newest darling of the Nigerian music industry, Teni will be vying with other colleagues such as with Legbegbe’ crooner, Mr Real, Chinko Ekun and Victor AD. Across town, Ms Genevieve Nnaji’s Lion Heart, the first Nigerian movie to premiere of Netflix, faces stiff competition from other fan favourites including the hilarious ‘Merry Men’ and the audacious ‘Chief Daddy’ for Nollywood Movie of the year. While on social media, Maraji, Lasisi Elenu and Broda Shaggy remained locked in a three-horse race for Social Media Comedy skit of the year, with fans seemingly caught between favourites. Speaking on the award’s polls, Mr. Ikechukwu Maduka, DAAR Awards’ digital communications strategist stated that, “We have seen some very interesting selections from Nigerians across the globe. The passion with which they have campaigned and supported their candidates inspires us to believe in the future of our continent and continue to reward excellence”.
