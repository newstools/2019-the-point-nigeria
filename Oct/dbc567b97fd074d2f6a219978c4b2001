 By Osemwengie Ben Ogbemudia, Benin Tragedy struck in the early hours of today (Saturday) around Uselu Shell area of Benin city, Edo state as a private vehicle rammed into four children killing them all. Uselu is a popular residential area of Benin, located along the ever-busy Benin-Lagos expressway, leading in and out of New Benin and Ring Road axis. Our reporter, who arrived a bit late to scene, said the community is currently on a lockdown following the unfortunate incident. The vehicle, a BMW drove by a middle-aged woman, was said to have had break failures before ramming into the four children-hawkers. Three of the four children are from one family, and another one said to be the only child of their parents. The incident happened exactly at the traditional ground in Uselu, which is put to use only during the coronation of a new Oba. Angry youths have taken over the major roads in protest, setting the vehicle ablaze and also making burn fire on the expressway. Details laterâ€¦
