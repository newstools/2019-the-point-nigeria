The Executive Secretary, Bauchi State Health Contributory Management Agency (BASHCMA), Dr Mansur Dada, has reiterated the agencyâ€™s commitment to providing residents of the state access to quality health care services. Dada said this while receiving members of Bauchi State Network of Civil Society Organisations (BASNEC), who visited the agency. According to him, the scheme being funded through deduction of one percent from salaries of civil servants is meant to complement the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) by giving those who are not enrolled into the scheme financial access to health services at any hospital of their choice in the state. He said the agency would launch the State Health Contributory Scheme to cater for residents of the state. This, he said, would encompass those in the formal and informal sectors and their dependents. Dada stated that the agency would liaise with the organised labour and leaders of market associations to collect periodic contributions from their members under the scheme. The executive secretary explained that the vulnerable people, such as the poor and those who live with disabilities, would be able to access free health services. Earlier, the Chairman of BASNEC, Jinjiri Garba, commended the state government for its efforts towards improving the health sector using the initiative. The network, he explained, is an umbrella body of over 3, 000 civil society organisations advocating good governance for the development of Bauchi State.
