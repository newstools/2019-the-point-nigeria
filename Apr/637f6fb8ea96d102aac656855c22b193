Governorship candidate of the Action Alliance in Imo state, Uche Nwosu, has said that he is ready to form a fresh alliance with his former party, All Progressives Congress in a bid to reclaim his alleged stolen mandate. According to him, he has put aside the purported injustice the APC meted on him since the party has realized its mistakes after its poor showing in the governorship and House of Assembly elections. Nwosu, who stated this on Tuesday in a chat with journalists, disclosed that he has petitioned the Tribunal against the declaration of Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as governor-elect. He added that he is confident that the election will be upturned. He said, “The national leadership of the APC made a mistake by not giving the party’s ticket to me, we warned them against giving the ticket to Hope Uzodinma but the leadership of the party ignored our warnings, but the outcome of the elections has justified us. “We joined the AA two months to the election and I won the governorship election if not for the manipulations, we also got two Federal House Representatives seats and eight seats in the State Assembly but now that they have realized their mistakes we are ready to form alliance with APC to reclaim our mandate. He pointed out that the declaration of the PDP candidate as the governor-elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission was an aberration to the Constitution and will not stand. “I have petitioned the Tribunal and I am sure that the issues raised which bother on constitution cannot be swept away, I am certain that I will reclaim my mandate in no distant time”. He stated that power has temporarily left the masses, stating that, “what is happening is an interim setback, it will soon be over and power will once more return to the people.” Nwosu also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for presenting level playing ground for all political parties during the elections.
