The Peoples Democratic Party secretary, Izzi local government area of Ebonyi, Hon. Ibeogu Cyril Nwaji, was reportedly beaten to coma by hoodlums recently. Our correspondent in Abakaliki gathered that Nwaji was on his way to Abakaliki shortly after a meeting with his party supporters in Izzi when he was attacked by unknown men. The victim narrated that he was driving to town on his motorcycle, and on getting to Nkwogu junction, a vehicle sped past him and suddenly turned back, facing his direction. He disclosed that, on getting to where he was, the car stopped and one of the occupants launched a plank on his head, injuring him in the mouth and knocking him down from his motorcycle. He said that was all he remembered until he woke up in the hospital. Nwaji said when he woke up, he was told that a good spirited Ebonyian, identified as John Igwele, who saw him lying lifeless along the  Ogoja-Abakaliki expressway, picked his (Nwaji’s) phone, thinking he was an accident victim. He searched through his contacts and got the phone number of an elder statesman, Eze John Nnaji Nwenyi, who later called other PDP faithful, including friends and family members, who rushed him to Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki for treatment. Nwaji, who spoke from his sick bed, said he never knew that he was being trailed from his village, where he had meeting with the party supporters, and accused members of the opposition party of being behind the attack. The local government PDP chairman, Hon. Okeye Nkemdirichukwu, said that effort was being made to get to the root of the matter. Efforts to get the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Loveth Odah, to comment on the matter at the time of filing this report were not
successful.
