As part of efforts to guarantee quick dispensation of justice against people who market hazardous products, the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency has been assigned a dedicated court to prosecute defaulters. The Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Opeyemi Oke, recently approved the Lagos State Consumers’ Protection Court to prosecute violators and help aggrieved consumers get redress when their rights are infringed upon. According to the Head of Public Affairs, LASCOPA, Mr. Dunkwu Divine, cases relating to consumer rights will be handled by Court 8, Ogba, Ifako-Ijaiye, presided over by a Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Dani Oni. Also speaking, the General Manager, LASCOPA, Mrs. Kemi Olugbode, said the Lagos State Consumer Court would strengthen the agency’s fight for the protection of consumer rights. “Henceforth, all consumer cases relating to both civil and criminal matters would now be decided at the new Consumers Court in order to ensure speedy trial
of cases.” She further stated, “LASCOPA will ensure that aggrieved consumers get redress from all forms of infringement on their rights. Matters not resolved during mediation will be prosecuted in court.” Olugbode, while calling on consumers to take advantage of the dedicated consumer court in Lagos State, also reassured the consumers that cases handled by LASCOPA would be done free of
charge. “All cases brought to the court by consumers will be handled free of charge by LASCOPA to ensure consumers gain their right from marketers,” she added.
