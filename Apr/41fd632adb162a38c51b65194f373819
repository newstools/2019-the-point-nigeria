Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) on Thursday rejected the All Progressives Congress (APC) choice of Senator Ahmed Lawan as Senate President. The youths on Thursday described the choice of Lawan as a stooge of the south-west and manipulation of North by the ruling party. The group in the statement signed by its National President, Yerima Shettima said it would be shameful for the North to “sit back and a watch a single Southwest politician deciding for the Northeast in particular and the whole North in general,” who should be the Senate president from the zone. They called on APC leadership to allow stakeholders and senators to choose who is the best among the aspirants. The statement read in part: “Allowing the imposition of Lawan to stand will portray the North as a mere manipulative pawn in the hands of one man, who has no business deciding for the North what it deserves “Much as it was decided that the Senate President should come from the Northeast, the Zone must be allowed to decide on the most acceptable choice, which is now obviously Senator Ali Ndume “The situation is totally undemocratic and therefore unacceptable to true Northerners. “We challenge anyone with convincing reason as to why Senator Lawan would not be acting the script of a Southwest politician who single-handedly imposed him on Nigeria, to come forward with such facts “The growing concern over Senator Lawan’s imposition “is all about the political future of the North and especially the journey towards 2023 and therefore we won’t tolerate any one-man agenda.”
