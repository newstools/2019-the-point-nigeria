The All Progressives Congress has alleged plans by top officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission to favour Governor Nyesom Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party during Monday’s resumption of collation of results of March 9 governorship and House of Assembly elections. In a statement on Sunday by the party’s State Publicity Secretary in Rivers, Chris Finebone, he also alleged that what was happening in Rivers state was in complete fulfilment of the tripartite collaboration between Wike, INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Obo Effanga and Administrative Secretary, Elder Etim Umoh. The opposition APC in Rivers further accused Governor Wike of desperation to be re-elected. The party said: “We condemn in strong terms, the so-called timeline and activities to conclude the March 9 governorship and House of Assembly elections in Rivers State, as announced at the stakeholders meeting. “It is a mere charade, well-organised and choreographed by INEC, in its bid to work from answer to question. “The ultimate result can only be to announce their (INEC’s) preferred partner and collaborator (Wike) as the winner against the AAC’s governorship candidate (Awara), who was clearly in the lead before collation was aborted (on March 10). “Whether INEC will succeed in its machinations will be seen in the days to come. “Several actions of INEC had prepared the minds of many that the entire exercise was skewed to favour Wike and the PDP, leaving in the process, several questions without answers. “How come that Wike knew about the 17 local government areas, which results had been allegedly collated and had posted same on his (Wike’s) official Twitter handle, long before INEC made the announcement? “Answers to this and other questions will continue to hang on the neck of INEC like an albatross.”
