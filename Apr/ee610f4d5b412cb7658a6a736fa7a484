The Senate Committee Chairman on Navy, Senator Isah Hamman Misau, has charged the Chief of Naval staff Staff, Vice Admiral Ibak Ekwe Ibas, to showcase activities of the Nigeria Navy. Speaking at the budget defence in Abuja on Tuesday, the lawmaker explained that the Committee saw a lot of activities of the Nigerian Navy when they went on oversight functions, but noted that their activities have been silent. According to him, the lack of showcasing their activities would raise suspicion of justification of annual budgetary allocation to the Navy. “I know that the Nigerian Navy is doing a lot in terms of maritime security, but you need to showcase arrest of criminals on the sea and showcase other activities.” “The activities of the Navy have been silent and what we saw during the oversight functions convinced us you are doing a lot.” Responding, the Chief of Naval staff said, Nigeria Navy was thinking ahead of criminals, hence, approval of year’s budget would assist the Navy in operation that is in line with the Federal government’s commitment in tackling insecurity. Chairman of the Committee on Navy, Senator Isah Hamman Misau presided over the Committee meeting for the first time after Senate’s resumption from election break.
