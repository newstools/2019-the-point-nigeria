The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has made it clear that his administration won’t intimidate or harass people of the state and members of the opposition in the next four years. Ganduje, who was re-elected during the just concluded supplementary election in the state, gave the assurance while stating that he would run an all-inclusive government in the next four years. In a statement signed by the State’s Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, the Governor urged opposition to work together with his government in the interest of the state. According to Ganduje: “I will not betray the people of the state and no one will be harassed or intimidated by my government. “We have no intention whatsoever to intimidate anybody be it civil servant or private citizen. Elections are associated with heated debate on political differences, but they are over and we have a big task of working together because Kano belongs to all of us.” The Governor also declared that he was ready to face the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which vowed to challenge his victory in court. Governor Ganduje accused the PDP of electoral malpractice during the just concluded supplementary election. He said: “Before the re-run election, which we emerged victorious, they were deep-neck in ballot stuffing and other electoral offences, a ploy that was later uncovered.”
