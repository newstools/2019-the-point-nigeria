Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, said he is ever ready to face the Peoples Democratic Party , which vowed to challenge his victory at the just concluded governorship election in court. According to the Governor, challenging his victory will consume the PDP in Kano. He spoke at Ganduje town in Dawakin Tofa Local Government, when he received thousands of supporters who trooped to congratulate him over his reelection yesterday. The governor said: “Before the rerun election, which we emerged victorious, they were deep-neck in ballot stuffing and other electoral offences, a ploy that was later uncovered. “It was after that the ballot stuffing scenario that a genuine election was conducted in which a genuine result emerged. “My thinking about these people is that they are about to kick-start what would later consume them. What they did in other elections of the state legislators in some places will be looked at, with the view to ascertaining authenticity of such votes they claimed to have gotten,” Ganduje said.
