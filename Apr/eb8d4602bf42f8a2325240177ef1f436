 AIICO Insurance Plc has launched a free Entrepreneurship Development Programme. As a socially responsible organization, AIICO seeks to contribute to nation building by empowering Nigerians with the requisite knowledge and skills for entrepreneurship. This is aimed at employment generation, poverty reduction and economic growth.
The programme is open to individuals who desire to have the freedom to pursue their own vision; become their own bosses; have flexible lifestyle and potentials for alternate sources of income beyond salary. While entrepreneurial opportunities are hanging low, not everyone is able to spot them and only few succeed in leveraging them. The programme helps to spot new business opportunities in Nigeria today and guides on dos and don’ts of succeeding. It is based on cutting edge information, tools and concepts of entrepreneurship.
According to Mr. Babatunde Fajemirokun, Executive Director and Chief Operations Officer, “Nigerians with entrepreneurial potentials and dreams of self-reliance can now take advantage of the programme to gain momentum and become viable, irrespective of challenges. We want to help them to see opportunities around them and equip them with the knowledge and skill to make the most of it, profitably. We have the manpower and have made adequate provisions to ensure the continuity of this programme.” Certificates shall be issued to participants upon successful completion.
AIICO Insurance Plc., a leading composite insurer in Nigeria, commenced operations in 1963. AIICO provides life insurance, health insurance, general insurance, wealth management and pension management services as a means to create and protect wealth for individuals, families and corporate customers
