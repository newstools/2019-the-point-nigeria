The Oba-elect of Ikeja community in Lagos, Alhaji Samsondeen Adeleye, has raised the alarm, over a plot by his detractors to get him arrested and detained under a trumped up charge, so as to prevent his installation by the outgoing administration of Governor Akinwumi Ambode. The monarch-in-waiting, in a chat with The Point at the weekend, accused one of his siblings of contriving an allegation bothering on land grabbing against him, noting that apart from lands jointly sold by their royal family, he had never single-handed, sold any land to anyone. “My detractor in the family had connived with some powerful people in the police circles to get me arrested for illegally selling a land, about which I know nothing. “I gathered that they will any moment from now, invite me to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police in Alagbon, Lagos, from where I will be transferred to Abuja, to prevent me from becoming the Oba of Ikeja. “They said they would arrest me in respect of a land sold, whereas I did not sell any land to anybody. Apart from lands sold jointly by the royal family, count me out of selling a family land behind other members,” he explained. Adeleye said he had contacted his lawyer to reach out to the Lagos Commissioner of Police, “to help me prevent this act of injustice from taking place.” “I know they are doing this to prevent my imminent installation by the state government,” he stressed. Ikeja has been without a monarch since October, 2014, following the passage of its traditional ruler, Oba Rauf Matemi, Amore 1. In December 2014, the Ikeja Body of Kingmakers, headed by the late former deputy governor of Lagos State, Chief Rafiu Jafojo, picked Adeleye as Oba-elect and forwarded his name to the Ikeja local council; but the state government has yet to install him ever since.
