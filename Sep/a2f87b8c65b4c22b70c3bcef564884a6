 PRISCILLA DENNIS, MINNA. Former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida has enjoined members of the Niger state House of Assembly to work in harmony with the other arms of government in state. IBB, who stated this during a courtesy visit by the lawmakers at his Uphill Country residence in Minna, said the people of the state stand to benefit immensely, if there is a healthy relationship among the executive, judiciary and legislators. He commended them on their performance so far in office, noting that it is up to the expectations of the people. He stated, “We have heard of states having lack of synergy between the arms of government but in Niger state, that should not be your lot. Keep a good working relationship among the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. You have been doing that and I want you to keep it up.” “I have been looking forward to meeting with you. I am proud to say that you have been doing well.” The elder statesman then charged them to initiate people-oriented programs and projects and ensure that they carry the people along. Earlier, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Honorable Abdullahi Bawa Wuse acknowledged the leadership role IBB had played, when he was the military President of Nigeria that ensured that it remained an indivisible entity. Against this background, he stated, “We are here to pay you a visit to get the blessings required to run the legislature and pilot the affairs of the Assembly effectively.” “We are here because, we know your concern and commitment to the development of this state and Nigeria.”
