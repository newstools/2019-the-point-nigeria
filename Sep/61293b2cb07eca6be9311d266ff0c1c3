 According to UNICEF, the prevalence rate of diarrhoea in Nigeria is 18.8%, accounting for an estimated 150,000 deaths yearly amongst children under five due to poor hygienic and sanitary practices. Since man cannot see, feel or smell bacteria, it is agreed that proper hand washing habits help protect you and your family and prevent bacteria from contaminating your food and key areas in your kitchen. To encourage good washing habits, Dettol, through the Clean Naija Initiative has started what it called #NationalHandwashChallenge. The goal is to get 20 million clean hands by the end of year 2020, and as such, everyone should personally champion the promotion of proper personal hygiene in Nigeria by joining the #NationalHandwashChallenge. Dettol has products such as the antiseptic liquid, the anti-bacterial soap and hand sanitizer which will be instrumental to the achievement of the challenge. Nigerians can join the challenge by taking a picture or video whilst washing their hands, after which they are expected to post it on social media, tag @DettolNigeria and @CleanNaijaNG, and also tag five of their friends to do the same using the hashtag #DettolCleanNaija.
