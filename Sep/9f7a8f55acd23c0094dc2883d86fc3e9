 PRISCILLA DENNIS, MINNA. No fewer than 9,000 graduands from the Niger State College of Education (COE), Minna were reported to have abandoned their certificates in the school in the last 24 years. The Provost, Prof. Yakubu Auna, made the disclosure in an interview with journalists on Sunday. According to the Provost, the uncollected certificates range between 1995 to date. He said despite several appeal by the school through various media, the owners have refused to claim them. “The management have taken drastic measures by writing to the state government requesting that those who secured employment into the state and local government service with statement of results from the institution should be made to submit their original certificates.” The provost wondered how a person who graduated for over 10 years from an institution would not care about his or her certificate. Auna also called upon employers to take interest in knowing the status of their employees through regular screening exercises, saying, “such measures would compel employees to update themselves regularly.” He described as unfortunate and disturbing how certain individuals “criminally” forged the institution’s certificates for the purpose of employment and other uses.
