 Osemwengie Ben Ogbemudia, Benin A former deputy governor of Edo State, Reverend Peter Obadan, has berated the critics of the embattled Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Obadan said that those criticising Osinbajo on the premise of his political position were myopic and shallow in their assessment of the vice president. Vice President Osinbajo has lately been in the eye of the storm following speculations that he had fallen out of favour with President Muhammadu Buhari and the powerful cabal in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa were now plotting his downfall. But the former deputy governor argued that there was nothing wrong for a pastor or any cleric to hold political or public office simultaneously. He argued that those expecting the vice president to become a different person after going into politics and taking office as the country’s number two man should not be taken seriously. Obadan lambasted the pastors and other clerics attacking Osinbajo, describing them as hypocrites who were nothing but wolves in sheep’s clothing. He said, “Let me presume that he is not a hypocrite. I was a pastor before politics and I have not changed. I was a member of the Supreme Executive Council of CGMI with Archbishop (Prof) Benson Idahosa as chairman and I am still with the church and the oldest member, still filled with the Holy Spirit and continuing my teaching, writing and preaching ministry. “I still practice as a chartered accountant and I’m also involved in politics. The scriptures must be fully preached without applying earthly wisdom, which is sensual and devilish. “If we despise pastors in politics, why collect offerings and tithes from politicians? Some of those in cassocks are not pastors but wolves.” The Edo State former deputy governor argued that criticising and condemning Osibanjo was a grave lack of knowledge of the Bible. “You need to rightly discern the Word of Truth,” Obadan said.
