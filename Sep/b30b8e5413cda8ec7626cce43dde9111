 AYO ESAN, ABUJA The Governor of Ekiti State and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, has felicitated with the Secretary to the Federal Government, Mr Boss Mustapha on his 63rd birthday anniversary. Dr. Fayemi, in his birthday message to the SGF, signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Public Communications, Segun Dipe, described Mr. Mustapha as a tested and trusted administrator. The NGF chair said he had had the privilege of working with the SGF on national assignments and could attest to his astute, pleasant and easy going aura. “Mr. Mustapha’s resume and accomplishments are intimidating, extending far and wide as a highly respected guru in the boardroom. Yet he has remained a very humble person. Never mind that he answers the name “Boss,” there is nothing bossy in his leadership style, rather he is more of a visionary and servant leader combined,” said Fayemi. According to the NGF Chair, despite being hardworking and highly resourceful, the SGF is a team player and indeed hardworking, committed and loyal to the Nigerian project. Dr. Fayemi thus wished the SGF many happy returns of the day.
