  The wife of the minister of Works and Housing, Mrs Abimbola Fashola is set to commission a less privileged center, Liberty Place, on October 1, in Lagos. In a statement made available to newsmen by Jandor Foundation, the center is expected to serve as the Foundation’s head office as well as secretariat. Speaking on this development, the Lead Visioner, Jandor Foundation, Mr. Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran said it was not accidental that the official commissioning coincides with Nigeria’s Independence Day celebration. According to him, it also strongly aligns and symbolizes the vision of the foundation, which is to empower the needy in the society towards helping them become independent and self-sufficient. He added, “The new office complex is part of our continuous improvement to the foundation’s support services model. The successes of our empowerment initiatives, especially over the past two years, have been very encouraging and an office complex such as this will provide the required support infrastructure and help us be better positioned to seamlessly execute future empowerment initiatives. We named it Liberty Place, we strongly believe it will help many, especially our indigent folks become independent on many fronts.” Other special guests and dignitaries expected at the event include top government functionaries, private sector leads, politicians, traditional rulers, sister NGO representatives and friends of the foundation. Jandor Foundation was formally established in 2017 as an organization committed to building structures that offer hope to the indigent in the society. In a society where hope is practically missing, the Foundation has quickly earned a reputation and identified as restorers of hope. In less than two years of operation in Lagos, the Foundation already has over 1,000 volunteer staff who helped to transform over 1,000 lives and commissioned over 150 projects.
