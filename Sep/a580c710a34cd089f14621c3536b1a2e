 PRISCILLA DENNIS, MINNA. Niger state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has revealed that in order to address the rising tide of banditry and security challenges facing the state, his administration has spent the sum of N470 million so far. Bello, who made the disclosure at a critical stakeholders meeting on the state of affairs in the state in Minna on Tuesday, said despite gestures to dialogue with them, the bandits have refused. “We have spent over N470 million on combating banditry and insecurity. The security situation in Niger state is becoming worrisome, however, the government is determined to ensure that the insecurity is addressed and brought down to its barest minimum.” He expressed concern at the way and manner the bandits have unleashed terror and fear on the state and the people having armed themselves with dangerous weapons. According to him, “These bandits have become more daring. We have used every opportunity to dialogue with them but those in the Pandogari axis have refused to listen to dialogue instead they have become more daring, armed and dangerous. “They seem to have remained committed to carrying out whatever activity they intend to do by unleashing terror and fear in the people of the state.” The Governor lamented that so far the number of Internally Displaced Persons has risen to 1,000 due to the activities of the bandits across the state. It would be recalled that in the last two weeks, bandits had stormed and raided over ten communities in the state dispossessing the people of their properties and sending them out of their homes.
