Following the perception of the capital market over the years, some financial analysts have said the market is witnessing both boom and burst cycles, in response to oil price volatility.
This is even as three hot stocks-FBN Holdings Plc, Zenith Bank Plc and Diamond Bank Plc, accounted for 551.865 million, last week.
A financial analyst and former stockbroker, Mr. Dolapo Ekehinde, said that the performance of the stock market underscored the fact it was not delinked from the macro economy, and that the market had not really grown over the years in terms of modus operandi, even though it had moved from analogue to digitised operations, but was still shallow in terms of the number and caliber of firms that were listed on it.
An asset management analyst, Oluwasina Ademola, also said most firms on the stock exchange are local rather than international. “So, there is the need to reform the exchange to attract or encourage listing by foreign or international businesses to increase its depth,” he said,
He added that government should not force companies to be listed, but could be engaged through mutually beneficial methods, particularly companies in the telecommunications and upstream sectors of the oil industry.
