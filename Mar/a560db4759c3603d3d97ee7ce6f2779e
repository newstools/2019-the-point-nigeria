Following series of appeals by some political parties for the removal of Zamfara State INEC commissioner, another group of political parties has move against the removal, calling on INEC chairman not to redeploy  the commissioner. In a press statement, a coalition of 20 registered political parties said they  were strongly against the idea of transferring Hajiya Asmau Sani Maikudi from Zamfara or deploying  her to another state as earlier demanded by the All Progressive Grand Alliance  Governorship candidate, Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi and the NRM Governorship candidate, Alhaji Saidu Mohammed Dansadau. The statement which was signed by 20 political parties and read by the Hope Democratic Party  governorship candidate, Alhaji Shehu Husaini , further stated that the State Resident Electoral Commissioner had been fair and transparent to all political parties in the state since her arrival in the state. According to the statement,  “The Electoral Commissioner has exhibited a good sense of maturity as such, all allegations labeled against her by the few unpatriotic citizens disguising in the name of politicians are barbaric and uncalled for. “We the 20 registered political parties have strongly condemn the calling of protest by those unscrupulous elements in the name of politicians, because we look at the current political tension and insecurity facing the state.” The statement also said no average Zamfara State indigene would call for protest, advising anybody with any grievances to follow due process and seek for redress in any court of law and not by calling for protest. The parties therefore appealed to the security agents to invite such “unscrupulous and unpatriotic citizens” so as to place them on serious security reasons. Recall that the governorship candidates of APGA and NRM, Shinkafi and Dansadau, respectively,  had called for the removal of State INEC commissioner and also the postponement of the governorship election to March 23rd to avoid crisis. The two governorship candidates had accused the INEC commissioner of conniving with the state government to allegedly rig the last Presidential and National Assembly elections in favour of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state.
