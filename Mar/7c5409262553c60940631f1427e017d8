Hearing in the suit of the Ogunsua of Modakeke chieftaincy tussle has, again, been adjourned to April 23 even as application for interlocutory injunction in the matter is kept in view.
Members of the Ogunsua ruling house in Modakeke (plaintiffs) had in suit number HMD/6/2018, challenged the right of Chief Moses Oyediran to aspire to be installed as a king on the town since he is known to be a chief (Balogun).
Justice A.L. Adegoke of the Osun State High Court, Modakeke had, earlier adjourned the case to Tuesday, February 26 for hearing after being mentioned for the first time on Wednesday, January 23.
At the court, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Dapo Adekunle, prayed the court for adjournment of the case in order to allow his team time to study the process which had just been served on them by the defense counsels on Monday.
As things stood in court at the time of filing this report, some parties involved in the case had just been served while others were yet to be served.
Specifically, while the process was served on the plaintiff’s counsel on Monday, counsel to first, second, third and fourth defendant, Mr Muyiwa Ogunleye, was served in court on Tuesday. However, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, had not been served as at court time yesterday.
Lead counsel to the fifth and seventh defendants in the motion for interlocutory injunction, Barrister Akinrotimi, agreed to the call for adjournment saying: “All parties in the matter need to be served and they need to react to the content of the process being served on them”.
Mr Adekunle, who called for adjournment, said: “Our stand is that there is presently no Oba in Modakeke. We are presently not disposed to accelerated hearing in this case. If we concede to that, the Rex of our case, which we meant to preserve, would be destroyed.
