Six people have reportedly been killed following an armed robbery attack on motorists along Ngurore-Yola road in Yola-South Local Government Area of Adamawa State. Reports on Saturday reveal that the robbers blocked the road from 7:00 to 9:00 pm on Friday, gunned down a commercial taxi driver, one Ababakar Ibrahim, whose car somersaulted into a ditch, killing all the five passengers on board. Residents and members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the area barricaded the road, which links Numan, the council headquarters of the Numan LGA, to the state capital, Yola. They protested the killing of one of their own and his passengers as well as hardship of motorists plying the busy road. An elder brother to the deceased, Aliyu Ibrahim, who confirmed the development, said he reported the attack to the police but that they failed to respond appropriately. He said, “Armed robbers on daily basis rob people of their valuables once it is 7:00 pm on this road. They operate with impunity, without any resistance from security agencies.”
