.As hope rises for pensioners Imo State Governor-elect, Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, has expressed fear that the state treasury might be empty before he assumed office in May. Addressing the leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress in Owerri, the state capital, the governor-elect said that he prayed that the treasury was not empty by the time they came on bound. That, notwithstanding, he said the payment of pensioners would remain his area of priority, adding that his word remains his bond. He warned all those who be tempted to do illegal last-minute transactions with the outgoing government, particularly financial institutions, which might result in further burdening the state with unsustainable liabilities that they would be doing so at their own peril. Ihedioha believed strongly that those in positions of authority must render account of their stewardship to the people. “The era of brazenness in Imo State is gone,” he assured. The governor-elect promised to run an open, transparent and accountable government with due process as its hallmark. He assured all Ndi Imo, both those who voted for him and those who did not , that he would be governor for all. “No part is greater or more important than the other. We are equal stakeholders in the Imo project and must therefore ensure that our people are united in the pursuant of the common good,” he maintained. Another priority, he said, would be the reclaiming the dignity of the Imo people, adding that Ndi Imo would no longer be the laughing stock of Nigeria as only positive, productive and progressive stories would be told of the new Imo.
