A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in the 2018 primaries in Abia State, Friday Nwosu, has called on the National Assembly and the national leadership of the APC, to cede the office of the Senate Presidency to the South East zone if inaugurated in June. The politician made the call, while reacting to the outcome of the just concluded 2019 Nigeria elections, saying “now that the zone has not only produced APC senators, but , also, went ahead to give the ruling party over 25 percent votes in three out of the five states from the area, it would be politically wise to zone the senate presidency to the South East. He said, “As it stands now, the president is from the North, his vice, from the South west; it is, therefore politically expedient that the Senate President position should go to the South East.” The APC chieftain also hailed the performances of his party in the just concluded 2019 Nigeria presidential election. He said he was not surprised that Buhari won the election, stressing that what the president achieved in just four years could not be achieved in 16 years the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP)was in power. Nwosu said the President has demonstrated a lot of zeal, love and patriotism, in the past four years, stating that it was good Buhari be allowed to finish what he started.
