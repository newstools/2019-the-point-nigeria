The Independent National Electoral Commission has given insight into why the electoral process in Rivers State was suspended. INEC had declared the election in the state inconclusive after suspending the collation of results for Saturday’s governorship and State Assembly elections due to electoral malpractice in the state. However, INEC explained that the electoral process in the state was called off due to violence and threat to life. The explanation was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Mahmoud Yakubu, Rotimi Oyekanmi. The statement reads partly: “In Rivers, the Commission was forced to suspend the election due to violence and threats to life, as a result of which it constituted a Fact Finding Committee to assess the situation and report back within 48 hours. “In a couple of other states where a declaration was not immediately made, the elections did not meet the threshold required for such a declaration. “The Commission will take the appropriate action prescribed by the law and make a declaration.”
