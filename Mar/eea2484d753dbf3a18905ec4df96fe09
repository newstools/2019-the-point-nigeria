The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the announcement of results for the March 9 elections in Imo State. INEC took the decision on Monday morning after a fight broke out at their office along Portharcourt road in Owerri, the state capital. Drama started by 5:30 am, when the results from Ideato South local government area was about to be announced. The state party agent for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Onyegucha, raised an objection that the results should not be announced. “All the electoral officers were taken to a particular place to write the results. “Also, the party agents were driven away by the agents of the government and the results were written in favour of one candidate,” Onyegucha claimed. But party agents for the Democratic Alternative (DA), Paschal Onwukaike, challenged him (Onyegucha) on the reason for which the results should be cancelled. At a point, both agents were forced to engage in a loud argument which resulted to fighting and torching INEC materials. Security operatives at the INEC office have already arrested the duo of Onyegucha and Onwukaike.
