Zamfara State Government has stepped up efforts at tackling insecurity in the state with stringent measures being taken to stop armed bandits from penetrating into towns and villages for their nefarious activities. Checks by our correspondent indicate that as a result of adequate security arrangements put in place by the state government, the bandits who are fond of unleashing terror on the people of the state on a daily basis,  are now finding it very difficult to even come out from their hideouts while others have escaped to neighbouring states of Sokoro, Kebbi, Katsina and Kaduna . According to reports, all the black spots where the bandits used in conducting their heinous activities are currently being monitored closely by the security agents, while the civilian JTF members have been moving into the forest to hunt down the criminals. Sources disclosed that, as a result of this security arrangement, the bandits are being starved of food items as well as fuel for their motorcycles a situation which have greatly hampered their operations. The bandits, according to Government House sources, are currently seeking reconciliation with the state government, while the governor, Alhaji Abdul Aziz Yari, said that he would never enter into such an agreement with them. Governor Yari had declared a total war against the bandits, stressing that, his government would now pursue them with vigour, calling on the security agencies to redouble their efforts in fighting the insurgents. The police public relations officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, who spoke to our correspondent on phone said, a number of cattle and sheep recovered from the bandits are now in police custody, calling on the people whose cattle were stolen to come to the police for verification. According to him, the banditry activities have reduced to the barest minimum in the state, adding that, in the nearest future the state would completely be free of crime.
