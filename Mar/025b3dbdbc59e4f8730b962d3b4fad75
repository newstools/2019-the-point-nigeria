Two men suspected to be hoodlums were said to have been killed during a battle of supremacy recently at Ajegunle area of Lagos
State.
The unidentified men were alleged to be miscreants collecting illegal tolls from tankers and trucks drivers along the Ojo Road at Ajegunle.
A source, who gave his name simply as Adeyinka, disclosed that some hoodlums at Ezeagu and Turner streets, off Ojo Road, Lagos had been in a battle of supremacy over whose right it was to collect toll from tuck drivers plying Ojo Road.
He said since the collection of tolls from the drivers started the residents had not known peace because of incessant fight between the two rival groups adding
that no fewer than two
people were killed while many others were injured, including passers by in a recent
face-off.
He said, “The two rival gangs attacked each other. Two people were killed while many others were injured in a fight.
Many people who were returning from work were injured. They also used the opportunity to rob innocent people in the area.
“They were forcing tanker and truck drivers to pay money before they would allow them to pass. Youths from Ezeagu  and Turner streets collect toll and always fight. This is not the first
time they killed  during fight. They fought with guns and cutlasses. It was like a
war”.
Another resident, Eugene Umelo, said, “We are getting tired because of criminal activities by the youths in this area. If they are not robbing people and maiming, they are fighting and killing  over collection of tolls. Government should do something about
this.
“Ajegunle is becoming the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah. Some will rob and rape minors and married women. They would order son to make love to his mother at gunpoint. They would order father to make love to his daughter at gunpoint. What is the difference between Ajegunle and Sodom and Gomorrah?”
