Manchester United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has explained why the club appointed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the club’s permanent manager. The Norwegian signed a three-year deal to remain at Old Trafford. According to Ed Woodward, Man United appointed Solskjaer as the Red Devils boss because the 46-year-old brings more than just performances, results and a wealth of experience to the club. He also said that Solskjaer gives young players the chance to express themselves and to understand the culture of the club. “More than just performances and results, Ole brings a wealth of experience, both as a player and as a coach, coupled with a desire to give young players their chance and a deep understanding of the culture of the club. “This all means that he is the right person to take Manchester United forward. “I want to thank Ole and the coaching team for everything they have done so far and congratulate him on this richly deserved appointment,” Ed Woodward told Man United’s official website.
