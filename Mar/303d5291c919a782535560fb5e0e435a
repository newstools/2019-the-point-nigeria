The Nest Innovation Park for tech start-ups in Nigeria is located in the premium working district of Yaba environs in Lagos. The area hosts other active hubs similar to the Nest, so perhaps it’s safe to say the suburb can now be referred to as “YabaCon Valley” as there is a growing number of Techpreneurial development springing forth from that location.
