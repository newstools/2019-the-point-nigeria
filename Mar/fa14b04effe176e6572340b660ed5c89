The member representing Ibarapa/Ido Federal Constituency of Oyo State at the National Assembly, Hon Sunday Adepoju, has returned to his former party , the All Progressives Congress (APC). An associate of former governor of the state, the late Lam Adesina, Adepoju dumped the African Democratic Congress (ADC) to join his natural political family, the APC. The defection followed the return of former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, and Senator Adesoji Akanbi, among others to APC after the initial disagreements which took them to other political platforms. Adepoju’s mentor, who is the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is believed to have facilitated his return to the party in his bid to ensure that all the party members work together in harmony to deliver Oyo to APC and its governorship candidate, Adebayo Adelabu Penkelemesi. The lawmaker was enjoined to ignore the development that led to the parting of ways with APC and work for continuity in Oyo to foster continued peace and development. Adepoju on Thursday met with thousands of his supporters in Ido and Ibarapa Local Governments during which they pledged overwhelming support to ensure Adelabu’s governorship ambition is realised.
