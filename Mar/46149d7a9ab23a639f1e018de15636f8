The Danish Football Association are set to beat their Nigerian counterparts in the race for the services of Huddersfield Town star Philip Billing.
The central midfielder is in line to make his senior debut for the Scandinavian powerhouse when they face Kosovo and Switzerland on March 21 and 26 respectively, having received a maiden call-up to the national team.
In the event that Billing plays against Switzerland, he will become cap-tied to Denmark as the game taking place in Basel is a European Championship qualifier.
The 22-year-old was faced with a tough decision to make over the senior national team to commit his international future to as he’s eligible to represent the Super Eagles through his mum and had been approached by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to switch his allegiance ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
Commenting on his first call-up to Denmark’s senior team, Billing said: ”I knew well, the team was named today, but it was only when my mother wrote that I had been selected that I went into Facebook and saw it.
”It’s something I’ve been dreaming of since I was a young child. I went to the stadium when I was little to see international games, and hoped that one day I would be playing, so getting this first invitation is great.
