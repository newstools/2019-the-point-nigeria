Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Lagos chapter, has reached final decision on the governorship candidate to support for next Saturday’s elections. Ohanaeze yesterday adopted the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as its governorship candidate. According to Ohanaeze, the decision became imperative following the outcome of February 23 presidential and National Assembly elections. Ohanaeze pointed out that both the APC and PDP candidates are Lagosians, adding that the Igbo have no reason to fight, but look out for the candidate who will protect their interest. Ohanaeze reached the decision at a town hall meeting of stakeholders at the MUSON Centre, Lagos on Sunday. President of Ohanaeze Lagos, Solomon Ogbonna, said Igbo in Lagos decided to vote the APC candidate because, “he is a leader who will be there for us, and he is a man we can trust. “Sanwo-Olu is the best thing that can happen to the Igbo in Lagos; he is a God sent to the Igbo. “We must not waste this opportunity. That is why we must come out en masse on Saturday and vote for him.” The Ohanaeze President regretted the harassment of Igbo traders in parts of Lagos after the presidential election. He, therefore, called on Igbos to be more united and show love and concern as it is only through love and unity they can be protected.
