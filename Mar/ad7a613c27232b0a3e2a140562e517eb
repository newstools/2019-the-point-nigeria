The All Progressives Congress on Wednesday highlighted reasons why it endorsed Senator Ahmed Lawan as the Senate President of the ninth National Assembly. APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, explained that the party settled for Lawan as the next Senate President after wide consultations with President Muhammadu Buhari and other leaders of the party. He said the party “ranked Senators from all zones of the country who are qualified to contest the position, but only one of them can be Senate President.” Addressing journalists in Abuja, Issa-Onilu said the stand of the party not to share power in the national assembly with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was borne out of the fact that it has a clear majority and does not need the opposition to run a successful government. Issa-Onilu said having “settled for Lawan as Senate President, the party is working out an acceptable zoning formula for all other positions both in the Senate and House of Representatives, including the position of Speaker of the House.” He, however, observed that the party was aware of the fact that there are other Senators interested in the position. The APC spokesman insisted that the party won’t allow what happened in 2015 to repeat itself.
