Nigerians on  Wednesday joined the rest of the world to celebrate 2019 International Women’s Day with many drawing attention of government and policy makers to the importance of this year’s theme and demanding urgent  action on issues affecting women.#BalanceforBetter is the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day, which is observed each year on March 8. The 2019 initiative is aimed at gender equality, a greater awareness of discrimination and a celebration of women’s achievements, according to the International Women’s Day website. That includes reducing the global pay gap between men and women and making sure all are equal – and balanced – in activist movements, boardrooms and beyond. Series of events were organised to mark the day  in Nigeria by civil society groups and non-governmental organisations  to  press for gender equality and opportunities for women in all spheres of life especially in governance.In commemorating the day, the Network of Reproductive Health Journalists of Nigeria, called  for increase in the country’s Contraceptive Prevalence Rate and demanded that all in-coming state governments should consciously provide budget lines for family planning in their various states.The NRHJN  also requested that all budgeted funds for family planning be compulsorily and  timely released, for the purpose of ensuring services were provided at the Primary Healthcare level. According to a statement by the network signed by  its National Secretary, Mrs Yinka Shokunbi,  government at all levels were  also challenged to make  major commitment and ensure  that the nation’s Contraceptive Prevalence Rate  and acceptance of modern contraceptive methods reached  at least 27 percent by 2020.The statement reads: “Currently, the nation’s CPR is just about 14.3 percent. It is certain that if Nigeria truly wants to change the narrative of poverty as a nation, we must be truly committed to empowering women by giving them access to modern contraceptive methods and sexual reproductive health services as well as end the global gag rule.“According to the World Bank, Nigeria currently has the greatest number of people living in extreme poverty in the world. The primary reason for this development is that financial resources are scarce and the nation is producing more people than it can cater for.”There must as a matter of urgency and necessity also be the inclusion of all women regardless of any form of disability, in the provision and access to family planning services whenever there is demand in all primary healthcare centres in wards of various local governments all over the federation.”Commenting on this year’s theme and how  Nigerian women could  balance for a better life  especially at such a time when the economy was recovering from recession, the NRHJN urged the government to seek innovative programs and ways that would guarantee that  no woman was left behind when it comes to access to family planning services particularly modern contraceptives.From the submission of the chair of the Local Organising Committee, 5th Nigeria Family Planning Conference 2018, Dr. Ejike Oji, according to the statement, “for there to be inclusiveness and innovation in investment opportunities for everyone regardless of being a woman or man, there must be deliberate effort to bridge the gender disparity gap in education, employment opportunities and by giving everyone equal chances to thrive. “This must start with access to services that empower women to plan their lives which is, access to family planning services.”Oji further said : “Family planning services is a right and the only way we can make sure women and girls and men too, exercise this right, is to empower them to make those critical decisions based on their choices in an atmosphere free of coercion”. Also, for there to be a “Balance for Better” in the words of Chair, FP2020, Beth Schlachter, “One of the guiding principles of the FP2020 partnership is that no matter your gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, or marital status, you have the right to decide if, whether, or when to have a child.”She added: “For advocates and implementers, that means in addition to married couples and those living in close proximity to a range of high-quality health care services, we must also focus on the needs of the hardest to reach: rural women and refugees, gender and sexual minorities, unmarried couples, young people, and people with disabilities.”
